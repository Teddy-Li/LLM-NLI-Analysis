Her father Volodymir Poryvai and her mother Ludmila Poryvai (maiden name Bystrik) were conductors of the Kiev Teachers Choir Cappella ``Svitoch''. From an early age, Russya had an intense interest in music, especially Ukrainian folk music and European classical music.She started her first pianolessons at age 5 and continued studying through graduation from high school. Later, she was enrolled at Kiev Music College, named after composer Glier, where she studied piano and choirconducting. Shortly before graduating from College she met and latter married Konstantin Ossaoulenko, musician and songwriter. Together they formed a team and became one of the most successful performer-songwriter teams in Ukrainian pop music of late 80's and early 90's. Russya's first album ``The Fortuneteller'' 1989, was a major success. The album contained 3 Top 10 Ukrainian hits, #1 ``Don't Stand By My Window', ''The Mermaid``, and the title track itself, ''The Fortuneteller. The follow-up album, ``The Enchanted Circle'' in 1989, brought her wide recognition in Ukraine and another #1 title song. The following year 1990, she released the album, ``Forgive Me Mommy''. This album won her the title, Best Female Artist of Ukraine. The album spawned another #1 ``Forgive me Mommy'' and three more Ukrainian Top 10 songs, ``Whatever Will Be, Will Be'', ``Let Them Talk'', and ``Little Swan''. In the summer and fall of 1990 Russya continued touring in support of the album, ``Forgive Me Mommy''. The fourth album, ``Cinderella'', was released in May 1991 . The song ``Blondie Girl'' went straight to #1 for the entire summer of 1991. The album also produced two more Ukrainian top 10 songs, ``Cinderella'' and ``Don't Forget''. For the second time, back to back in 1991, she won The Best Female Artist of Ukraine award. In late 1991, Russya traveled to Canada to record an album for the Yevshan Ukrainian record label in Montreal. It was her first release of an album in Canada and the United States. The album was entitled just simply ``Russya''. She remained in Canada to support the album release and performed at concerts in Ukrainian clubs and Churches throughout Canada and the United States. In 1993 after the untimely death of her father, she returned to the studio to record an album of classical Ukrainian pop songs, ``Cheremshyna'', dedicated to the memory of her parent. The album was released in 1994. It did not receive the high acclaim of her previous albums mainly due to the difference in style and genre. The same year she went back into the studio and recorded the album, ``Kiyv Girl''. The title song made its way into the Ukrainian top 10 in 1994. The next album, ``My American Guy'' was released in 1997. Russya retired from recording pop music in 1997 but continued to tour, sometimes with her sister Natasha Koroleva til 1999. In 2007 she returned to the recording studio and released her CD entitled, ``The Best Of Russya''.

He was reading with good hopes for classical honours, and was a private pupil of Dr. Vaughan; but even at that early age he was suffering from the disease to which he eventually succumbed. Although the state of his health prevented him from competing for university honours or obtaining a college fellowship, he was known to possess ability; and soon after taking his degree he was appointed college librarian (4 June 1845). He held this office until a few weeks before his death, when he returned to his father's house. Physical weakness prevented the sustained effort necessary for the production of any important work; but for the last six years of his life he contributed to the press. Most of his writings appeared in the Spectator or in Fraser's Magazine, the only one to which his name was attached being an essay on Tennyson's poems, contributed to the Cambridge Essays of 1855. He died 29 May 1857. A selection of his essays was made after his death and published with a prefatory memoir by W. G. Clark. This volume contains notices of a large number of the writers who were contemporary with Brimley himself, and is of considerable value as representing the contemporary judgment by a man of cultivation and acuteness on the writers of the middle of the nineteenth century, most of whom are now being judged by posterity.

As of February, 2010, her best finish in any competition was 2nd, at a giant slalom event in Germany.

She is scheduled to compete in both the slalom and giant slalom competitions there, although she was not expected to be in serious competition for a medal. Her participation on behalf of Peru was questioned by some, as she was not only born in Germany but lives there and is of Peruvian descent on only one side of her family. She and her brother were last minute additions to the Olympic roster. They both met the minimum time qualifications for participation, but that participation was questioned as neither had taken part in a World Championship prior to the Olympics. In response to this criticism, the Peruvian Olympic Committee explained that they were in the process of receiving their Peruvian passports when the last World Championships took place, and so could not yet compete on behalf of Peru. The controversy also prompted some commenters to question why the Peruvian government has not done more to identify and develop athletes within the country. However, the practice of smaller countries sending athletes who are technically citizens of those countries but who reside elsewhere to participate in international competitions is not uncommon.

One account given of his history states that his proper name was Philippe, and that he served as a French officer in the campaign in Flanders, but afterwards devoted himself to the pursuit of art. He was endowed with extraordinary capacity; and had his application been but equal to his genius, few would have surpassed him in the branch of art to which his natural disposition directed him. He had a peculiar talent for drawing landscapes, either from nature or his own fancy, with a readiness that was altogether surprising. Unfortunately, from his idle and dissolute course of life, he seldom exercised his abilities until compelled by necessity. The drawings, in chalk and with the pen, which he has left make us deeply regret that the irregularity of his life has limited these admirable productions to a much smaller number than his uncommon facility would otherwise have secured to us. Chatelain was much employed by Boydell, especially in engraving with Vivares the series of landscapes after Claude, Rembrandt, Guaspre, and others. Vivares being more appreciated by the public, his name was often placed on plates engraved by Chatelain alone, as in the case of a fine landscape after Pietro da Cortona, and another named 'The Storm,' in which Poussin has introduced the story of Pyramus and Thisbe. He engraved, also for Boydell, eleven views in London and in Italy. He died in London in 1771.

She became ``The Honourable Catherine Pakenham'' when her father succeeded as the 2nd Baron Longford in 1776. She had met Wellesley in Ireland when they were both young, and Wellesley, after numerous visits to the Longford's Dublin home, made his feelings towards her clear. At the time her family disapproved of the match: Wellesley was the third son of a large family and looked to have little in the way of prospects. After the rejection by the Pakenhams, Wellesley became serious about his military career, was posted to the Netherlands and India, enjoyed a spectacular rise, and seemingly forgot Kitty.

Graph Nobel began theatre at a young age allowing her an early introduction to the arts. Graph Nobel discovered hip hop in her teenage years, which inspired her to explore her creative abilities as an artist. Graph Nobel, upon reflection of her growth as an artist, cites the video for ``Bonita Applebum'' by a Tribe Called Quest as a muse for such creative possibilities. Writing her first songs at the age of 14, Graph Nobel would begin to perform studio recordings 3 years later under the Canadian producer 2Rude. Nobel Graph's hip-hop inspired ambition of becoming an emcee led her to move to New York, in hopes of immersing herself in the city's hip hop scene. After returning from New York, Nobel continued to explore new genres and push creative boundaries. However, Graph's passion to explore new sounds conflicted with the interests of her female hip-hop group, Gravity, causing the group to split on creative differences. Nobel would later find the multi-instrumentalist, producer Martin ``Doc'' McKinney, producer of Esthero, Res, Sting, Hawksley Workman, and The Weeknd (Nobel would later write songs and record with Esthero, Hawksley and extensively with Res). Nobel became part of Black Corners collective, a collection of artists who chose a ``progressive approach to music'', avoiding the boundaries of a single genre. Together, Nobel and Doc experimented with various genres including rock, hip-hop and electronica. In the process, Nobel developed a distinct sound, incorporating atmospheric guitars, hip-hop beats, heavy bass lines, samples, string arrangements and innovative programming. Graph Nobel continued to work with Doc until 2006. In 2007 Nobel made recordings with labels Aftermath (Dr. Dre, Che Vicious, Mark Batson) and BME (Lil Jon).

He studied art in Paris, being the first Egyptian at the Louvre School. He was a pupil of Paul S\u00e9rusier, F\u00e9lix Vallotton and the Symbolist painter Maurice Denis. It can be said that he was attached to the artists of the Paris School - he worked beside Amadeo Modigliani - but he always refused to be considered one of them, keeping his independence and freedom. His family and the region of Brittany (where his children were born) provided him with subjects for many of his paintings, before trips to Egypt led him to rediscover the lights, landscapes and characters of his childhood. He excelled in portraits, nudes and landscapes both in France and in Egypt and was enchanted by the old districts of Cairo.

He commenced his artistic career by carving in wood, and then designed illustrations for unimportant works, executing in 1799 ten plates for Goethe's 'Hermann and Dorothea. ' He next worked in Indian ink and water-colours, producing in 1806 a large piece in the latter medium, representing 'The Death of Nicholas of Bernau,' which gained him admission into the Berlin Academy. In 1807 he went to Paris, where he studied oil painting. The year 1812 found him at Rome, and there his education as an artist was much advanced by his connection with Koch, Overbeck, Schadow, and Cornelius. His inclination led him more especially in the direction of painting landscapes with architectural details or prominent figures introduced. He attached himself to the new classic school of landscape, labouring especially to make his perspective tell effectively, and to gain a great mastery over light and shade. His ideas gained much in point of breadth from a visit to Sicily, which he made in company with Prince Golitsuin in 1818. He settled at Macerata in 1830, but returned home on a visit in 1840, on which occasion a professorship was bestowed on him by the King of Prussia.

Bernard Levin wrote critically of Schoenman's influence on the aged philosopher, painting Schoenman as partly responsible for Russell's virulent anti-Americanism, in contrast to his earlier pronouncements against communism. Russell said of Schoenman, ``You know he is a rather rash young man, and I have to restrain him.'' . In 1963, Schoenman participated as Russell's secretary in attempts to mediate a solution for the Sino-Indian border conflict, after China declared a ceasefire the previous year.

He was educated at a private school and began work for his father's firm about the age of 14. By 1819 he had become a partner in his father's business and was soon noted for his ability as a cotton buyer. His business prospered, and the firm traded with China, India, South America and the United States, dealing in many other commodities. For a time he was in partneship with Samuel Faulkner whose son George was his closest friend. The business was carried on at Carpenter's Lane in Manchester while Owens resided at Nelson Street, Chorlton on Medlock. It is recorded that he was a man of very retiring habits who kept no company whatever. He spent evenings quietly among his books. He was a Liberal in politics and a Congregationalist by religion though in his later life he left off worshipping in chapel and attended an Anglican church. His large fortune he suggested leaving to his friend and partner George Faulkner (1790--1860), already a rich man. But by the latter's advice he bequeathed it to trustees for the foundation of a college (Owens College, Manchester, opened 1851, now part of the University of Manchester), based upon his own ideas of education. His will was made in May 1845.

The Pittsburgh Courier ran a front page article on the conversation shortly after the USA entered the Second World War. Wright noted that throughout the conversation, Hitler though calm, asked questions and immediately gave his own answers. For example, he asked ``Don't you think your people are destined perpetually to be slaves of one kind or another?'' and replied ``Yes! Your people are a hopeless lot. I don't hate them... I pity the poor devils.'' The conversation was dramatically reenacted in 1944 on the anti-racist radio show New World A-Coming.

He lifted 125\u00a0kg, the same weight with the champion, but ended second only losing by his body mass. In the same year he participated in the 1972 Summer Olympics. At the age of 27, the 17 Nentori weightlifter broke the Olympic record established by Yoshinobu Miyake in the clean and press style by lifting 127,5\u00a0kg. It was 29 August 1972 when Pampuri broke the record and became World Champion. However he didn't manage to win the Olympic medal as he was injured in the snatch style and he finished only ninth. Apart from the titles and medals, he is awarded the ``Mjeshter i Madh i Punes'' (``Great Master of Work'') and the highest title of the Albanian Republic, the First Class Naim Frasheri title. In 1981 he retires from the sport which gave him so many emotions. He goes back in the Cirku i Tiranes where he retires in 1994. In 2006, Ymer Pampuri returned once again in weightlifting in the age of sixty three years old. He participated in the Masters World Championship along with other retired weightlifters.

At the age of 4, she moved with her family (father Carlo Esposito, mother Iris Barzaghi, and sister Adriana Esposito) to Padova. After graduating from High School (classics, with Greek and Latin) she studied Chinese language and philosophy at the University of Venice (Ca'Foscari), Fudan University in Shanghai, and the University of Gent in Belgium. After graduation with a thesis on Qigong in 1987, she continued her studies under the direction of Prof. Isabelle Robinet at the Department of Far Eastern Studies of the University of Paris. After obtaining the Diploma of Advanced Studies (D.E.A.) on texts of the Daoist canon in 1988, she returned to Shanghai and studied at the Academy of Social Science of Shanghai under the direction of Prof. Chen Yaoting. Her graduate studies ended in 1993 with a summa cum laude Ph.D. in Far Eastern Studies; thesis The Dragon Gate - The Longmen school of Mount Jin'gai and its alchemical practices according to the Daozang xubian (complement to the Daoist canon). During several stays in China and Tibet, Dr. Esposito conducted extensive field work on Qigong, Taiji, Daoist and Buddhist (particularly Zogchen) practices in China. After post-doctoral studies at the Department of Indological and Far-Eastern Studies of the University of Venice (1994-1995), at the Sorbonne in Paris (1995-1997), and at Kansai University in Osaka, she established permanent residence in Kyoto in 1998 and married Urs App. Between 1998 and 2003 she concentrated on field studies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and continental China leading to the production, together with her husband, of several highly acclaimed video productions about Far Eastern religions. After being elected Associate Professor at Kyoto University's Institute for Research in Humanistic Studies (Jinbun Kagaku kenk\u00fbjo) in 2003, Dr. Esposito continued her research on Daoist texts of the Ming and Qing periods. She conceived and directed the Daozang Jiyao research project (), an international research project with over sixty scientific collaborators on the most important Daoist text collection of the Qing period. For portions of this large project, which began in 2006, Dr. Esposito obtained important grants from the Chiang Ching-kuo foundation (2006-2009 and 2010-2013) and from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS; 2008-2011).

The exact spot is not known with certainty, but it is plausibly identified with Gueder, possibly the haven where the Spaniards had in the 15th and 16th centuries a fort called Santa Cruz de Mar Pequena. Glas made an arrangement with the Lords of Trade whereby he was granted \u00a315,000 if he obtained free cession of the port he had discovered to the British crown; the proposal was to be laid before Parliament in the session of 1765. Having chartered a vessel, Glas, with his wife and daughter, sailed for Africa in 1764, reached his destination and made a treaty with the Moors of the district. He named his settlement Port Hillsborough, after Wills Hill, earl of Hillsborough (afterwards marquis of Downshire), president of the Board of Trade and Plantations (1763--1765). In November 1764, Glas and some companions, leaving his ship behind, went in the longboat to Lanzarote, intending to buy a small barque suitable for the navigation of the river on which was his settlement. From Lanzarote he forwarded to London the treaty he had concluded for the acquisition of Port Hillsborough. A few days later he was seized by the Spaniards, taken to Teneriffe and imprisoned at Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

The resulting images include allusions to the material by which the models are absorbed or into which they disappear. His work was included in the 120 year survey of the nude exhibition ``Body Work'' at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, alongside the work of Edward Weston, Bill Brandt, Eadweard Muybridge, E. J. Bellocq, and Edward Steichen. Bernhard later continued to devote all his energy taking photographs and bringing them together to enhance their meaning with visual interplay. This is evident in his ``Diptychs'' and sequencing series ``Drift''. He was profiled in the documentary show ``Temps Present'' on Swiss Television TSR (Switzerland) and the global network TV5 Monde.
