His father was Sardar Jai Singh and mother was Sardarni Sada Kaur. Baba Ji was born in Village Sherpur Kalan Jagroan in Ludhiana, India. He is regarded one of the highest saints in Sikhism. Baba Ji was a saint who meditated the gods name at every breath. At a very young age Baba Ji would go out at the middle of the night and meditate Waheguru. Once his parents on not seeing him in his bed got worried and started looking for him. They were surprised to see him sitting on the edge of the well with his eyes closed and in deep meditation.The above advice and instructions changed the life of Baba Nand Singh Ji and made him to go to the forest for further meditation. After a period of meditation, he returned from the forest and camped just outside the village and continued with his meditation irrespective of the local climatic conditions. The villagers upon observing this built a temporary house for him. After sometime the people from Kalera Village came and requested him to visit their village. He accepted their invitation and set out for Kalera. On the way he stopped at a well which was between Kaunke Village and Kalera and decided to camp there. The villagers over there made a small hut for Baba Ji and Baba Ji started his meditation.Baba Nand Singh Ji later established his ``Dera'' (centre) near Kalera in Punjab. He led a simple life and continued with the same principles of deep meditation. The food for the ``Dera'' would come from different devotees though no cooking was done at the ``Dera'' itself. This practice is still continued by the ``Dera'' now popularly known as Nanaksar. The food, ``langar'', is not prepared at Nanaksar but it is sent by the nearby villages and no matter how big the congregation, never ever has there been a shortage. No monetary offerings are ever made in front of the Guru Granth Sahib at Nanaksar, as the usual practice is at other Gurdwaras, but never a shortage of funds has occurred there. Baba Ji did not use any money on himself. He always served the community with true love and affection. It is said that once Maharaja Bhupender Singh of Patiala came to offer one lakh rupees for the Gurdwara fund but Baba Ji politely refused the offer. This was the first time someone had ever declined the offer of accepting money for a religious place from a Maharaja and of course the Maharaja felt bad and told Baba Ji, ``You will not find a donor like Bhupender Singh''. To this Baba Ji replied, ``You will not find another person who is prepared to sacrifice everything and yet be fully committed like Nand Singh''. This made the Maharaja humble and respectful and he bowed his head before Baba Ji. Baba Ji died in 1943 (13 Bhadron Sanmat 2000) at the age of 73.

He attended the gymnasium at Mainz, studied theology at Gie\u00dfen, and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest at Mainz on 14 August 1839. His first charge was that of chaplain at Seligenstadt. Like his colleague, Christoph Moufang, he was one of the founders and teachers of the Progymnasium of that city. He became spiritual director of St. Rochus Hospital at Mainz in 1845, and pastor at Abenheim near Worms in 1847. On 21 June 1852, he was appointed director of the Hessian Catholic teachers' training college at Bensheim.

Kraft was sent to South-East Asia during the war by the German high command as a part of the larger Indo-German Conspiracy and turned a British double-agent at Singapore in 1915. A German planter from Batavia, Kraft enlisted in the Imperial German Army at the beginning of World War I and served in France. Various accounts indicate he was either wounded in battle or faced courtsmartial due to his activities in France for which he faced a possible death penalty, against which he was given the option of returning to Batavia and help organise for the secret shipments or arms to be transferred to the Indian revolutionary underground agreed between the Ghadar Party, the Berlin Committee, and the German Foreign Office. Kraft returned to Batavia to coordinate with Knipping, the German Consul to Peking, but at the same time establisheed contact with the British mission. The intelligence passed on by Kraft, along with that of another agent named Oren were instrumental in uncovering parts of the Hindu-German Conspiracy, especially the plans to ship arms to India onboard the SS Maverick and the Henry S in June 1915. Kraft's information was also key in uncovering the proposed sites on the coast of Bay of Bengal where the arms were to be shipped, the operations of Jatindranath Mukherjee's agent Narendranath Bhattacharya with German ministers in South-East Asia, as well as details of Jatin Mukherjee's plans for insurrection in Bengal in August in August 1915. Kraft leaked details of the plans by German consul at Shanghai, Knipping, to raid the penal colony of Andaman islands on Christmas Day 1915 and raise an expeditionary force to raide towns on the Indian coast including Madras and Calcutta. His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meantime revealed to Beckett by ``Oren'', but given the successive failures of the Indo-German plans, the plans for the operations were abandoned on the recommendations of both the Berlin Committee and Knipping. Vincent Kraft was also responsible for passing on to British intelligence detailed information of the Berlin Committee and details of its activities in Washington D.C, in Siam, Dutch East Indies, and in Persia. Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war.

Growing up in a rural area, he spent his early life working on family farms in Bayou Pierre in DeSoto and Caddo Parishes. This led to a deep appreciation for the land and for hard work. In 1919 he graduated valedictorian from Shreveport High. In 1923 he received his undergraduate degree from Tulane University and then a medical degree in 1925. He participated in sports and was a member of Beta Theta Pi, the Nu Sigma Nu medical honor fraternity, and the Alpha Omega Alpha and Stars and Bars honor societies. Webb married Dorothy Dodd, daughter of Reverend Monroe E. Dodd, pastor of First Baptist Church, in 1926. They had two sons, Clarence, Jr. and Elmon Dodd. Webb practiced medicine in Texas, Minnesota, and Illinois from 1929 until 1931 when he received his Master's in Pediatrics from the University of Chicago. After receiving his Master's, Webb moved his family back to Shreveport and opened the first Well Baby clinic, in the Shreveport Public Health Department, with a friend. This clinic served the area for fifty years and Webb remained there until his retirement in 1976. He held teaching positions at four universities and served on the staff at six hospitals. By 1940, he was a charter member of the Society for American Archaeology and joined the Texas Archaeological Society where he attended annual meetings and participated in paper presentations. Webb's interest in archaeology did not occur until 1934 when he accompanied his sons on a Boy Scout trip near Menas, Arkansas. According to friends, this day changed his life. Webb began studying reports and techniques of well-known archaeologists such as James A. Ford. His next move was to contact Edward Neild and Michael Beckman, two Shreveport collectors who became lifelong friends of Webb's. In 1935 Webb traveled to Poverty Point and uncovered a cache of about 1,500 stone vessel fragments, which was the first of many visits to the site either surface collecting or conducting excavations. Even though his first large scale excavation project was some years in the future, salvage archaeology was occurring in the south during this time under the auspices of New Deal labor relief programs. One of the sites examined was at Marksville, Louisiana where the project archaeologists, Frank Setzler, aided by James Ford, became Webb's mentors. Over the next few years, Webb worked on many sites and met well-known archaeologists like Arden R. King, Robert Stuart Neitzel, Edwin Doran, Carlyle Smith, and William Malloy. James Ford and Edwin Doran's interest in the stratigraphic occurrence of potsherds in middens probably influenced Webb's interest in cultural chronology and site descriptions, especially at Poverty Point. In the 1930s Webb met James B. Griffin, who assisted him in pottery classification. During the same time, the University of Oklahoma began its archaeological program and Webb made friends with Robert Bell, David Baerreis, and Kenneth Orr. Webb also met Alex Krieger on an excavation in Texas and the two collaborated on a number of projects over their careers. Later in the 1930s Webb began to conduct his own excavations, with field most notably at Poverty Point and the Gahagan Mounds. He conducted projects regularly over the next thirty years. During his work at Poverty Point, Webb created an extensive and well documented surface collection from the site.

Tserendondov had struggled for the Setsen Khan throne but lost to Demchigdorj. Tserendondov died leaving Navaanneren an orphan to be raised by his uncle. When he was young he studied to become a monk and mastered the Manchu and Chinese languages. He became Setsen Khan in 1910 because the previous Khan Demchigdorj died without a son and he was the next in line (there was an unsuccessful attempt on Navaanneren's life). In this way Navaanneren was thrown into state affairs and left the monastic state. He was described by many as an approachable, kind-hearted man. In 1910 Mongolia was still part of the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644--1911). The Setsen Khan had submitted to the Manchus in 1691 at Dolonnor. While the Manchus recognized the Setsen Khan and left his large territory in Eastern Mongolia intact they were aware that this was a pre-Manchu Khanate and so established numerous banners (khoshuu) inside the Setsen Khan Aimag, giving a great deal of power to the governors (zasag) of the banners while appeasing the Setsen Khans with regular lavish presents and high salary. After 1911 when Mongolia was freed from Manchu rule and the Bogd Khaganate (1911--1919) was established Navaanneren was given the title ``Mahasamadi Dalai Setsen Khan'', made Minister of Justice (Shiguhu Yaman-u Sayid), elevated 31 grades, given 20 decorations, a three-eyed peacock feather otgo, green-colored hereditary Royal Coach, yellow vestment and orange reins.

Although Sergei was told that his father died by being shot, he found out much later from a friend of his father's that when Nikita Khrushchev became Premier of the Soviet Union, he had ordered the elimination of important officers who had supported Stalin in order to consolidate his power, and that Nikolai Kourdakov had been one of them.

Cochran began his commercial farming career growing strawberries using conventional methods, but switched to organic methods after he was nearly poisoned by pesticides and, as a result of this experience, questioned the effect that the chemicals had on his workers. He started Swanton Berry Farm in 1983 near Santa Cruz, California and subsequently developed a wide range of new methods, which include crop rotations, such as broccoli and brussels sprouts, trap crops such as mustard and alfalfa, and the use of natural predators, to control strawberry specific pests and diseases. His mostly intuitively developed methods were later verified scientifically in a series of studies by University of California, Davis plant pathologist Krishna Subbarao and his collaborators. Cochran originally found it difficult to get funding for his experiments from the California Strawberry Commission, stating that ``The industry blockaded our efforts to get money to research alternatives, and spent a lot of money in Washington making sure our proposals didn't get funded.''

His earliest works are travel logs and endearing portraits of friends including Hannah Wilke, Alice Neel, Annie Sprinkle, Eric Bogosian, Louis Waldon, and Larry Rivers. The label ``video artist'' was applied retroactively when Auder began exhibiting his work in 1980.
