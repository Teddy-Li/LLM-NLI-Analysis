Ansell (born 1952) is a Chicago-based physician, health activist and author whose efforts at both the national and local levels have advanced concerns about health inequities and the structure of the US health care system. His thirty years as a provider to the medically underserved have made him a vocal supporter of single-payer health care. He spent seventeen years at Cook County Hospital currently known as John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County upon which the medical T.V. drama ER was based. Ansell was inspired by his time at Cook County Hospital to write a memoir and social history entitled, COUNTY: Life, Death, and Politics in Chicago's Public Hospital. County was hailed as a ``landmark book'' by Julia Keller of the Chicago Tribune, aiming ``to inform and to inspire'' readers about the disparities in health care. In the book, Ansell argues that only a single-payer solution that provides access to all US residents regardless of circumstances can provide relief for those closed out of the health care system."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"5931713396332667652","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"5041981048872631403","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3571030073219370006","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3615053018572949242","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"yes"}]}

Tserendondov had struggled for the Setsen Khan throne but lost to Demchigdorj. Tserendondov died leaving Navaanneren an orphan to be raised by his uncle. When he was young he studied to become a monk and mastered the Manchu and Chinese languages. He became Setsen Khan in 1910 because the previous Khan Demchigdorj died without a son and he was the next in line (there was an unsuccessful attempt on Navaanneren's life). In this way Navaanneren was thrown into state affairs and left the monastic state. He was described by many as an approachable, kind-hearted man. In 1910 Mongolia was still part of the Manchu Qing dynasty (1644--1911). The Setsen Khan had submitted to the Manchus in 1691 at Dolonnor. While the Manchus recognized the Setsen Khan and left his large territory in Eastern Mongolia intact they were aware that this was a pre-Manchu Khanate and so established numerous banners (khoshuu) inside the Setsen Khan Aimag, giving a great deal of power to the governors (zasag) of the banners while appeasing the Setsen Khans with regular lavish presents and high salary. After 1911 when Mongolia was freed from Manchu rule and the Bogd Khaganate (1911--1919) was established Navaanneren was given the title ``Mahasamadi Dalai Setsen Khan'', made Minister of Justice (Shiguhu Yaman-u Sayid), elevated 31 grades, given 20 decorations, a three-eyed peacock feather otgo, green-colored hereditary Royal Coach, yellow vestment and orange reins. He also continued as Setsen Khan for two years under the Constitutional Monarchy period (1921--1924). His queen did not give birth to a son. He divorced his queen and became a monk again in 1922 taking the monastic name Yundenbazar.

Cochran was born in Carlsbad, California in 1947. He studied child development and European intellectual history at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the late 1960s, where he became interested in alternative farming methods. Cochran began his commercial farming career growing strawberries using conventional methods, but switched to organic methods after he was nearly poisoned by pesticides and, as a result of this experience, questioned the effect that the chemicals had on his workers. He started Swanton Berry Farm in 1983 near Santa Cruz, California and subsequently developed a wide range of new methods, which include crop rotations, such as broccoli and brussels sprouts, trap crops such as mustard and alfalfa, and the use of natural predators, to control strawberry specific pests and diseases. His mostly intuitively developed methods were later verified scientifically in a series of studies by University of California, Davis plant pathologist Krishna Subbarao and his collaborators. Cochran originally found it difficult to get funding for his experiments from the California Strawberry Commission, stating that ``The industry blockaded our efforts to get money to research alternatives, and spent a lot of money in Washington making sure our proposals didn't get funded.'' Cochran's methods have been credited for making a large-scale commercial organic strawberry industry possible in California. Cochran was also the first, and still one of the few, California organic farmers to have a contract with the United Farm Workers."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"18349444711114572460","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"10201641847309736017","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14953915240951219400","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3571030073219370006","judgment":"yes"}]}

Kraft was sent to South-East Asia during the war by the German high command as a part of the larger Indo-German Conspiracy and turned a British double-agent at Singapore in 1915. A German planter from Batavia, Kraft enlisted in the Imperial German Army at the beginning of World War I and served in France. Various accounts indicate he was either wounded in battle or faced courtsmartial due to his activities in France for which he faced a possible death penalty, against which he was given the option of returning to Batavia and help organise for the secret shipments or arms to be transferred to the Indian revolutionary underground agreed between the Ghadar Party, the Berlin Committee, and the German Foreign Office. Kraft returned to Batavia to coordinate with Knipping, the German Consul to Peking, but at the same time establisheed contact with the British mission. The intelligence passed on by Kraft, along with that of another agent named Oren were instrumental in uncovering parts of the Hindu-German Conspiracy, especially the plans to ship arms to India onboard the SS Maverick and the Henry S in June 1915. Kraft's information was also key in uncovering the proposed sites on the coast of Bay of Bengal where the arms were to be shipped, the operations of Jatindranath Mukherjee's agent Narendranath Bhattacharya with German ministers in South-East Asia, as well as details of Jatin Mukherjee's plans for insurrection in Bengal in August in August 1915. Kraft leaked details of the plans by German consul at Shanghai, Knipping, to raid the penal colony of Andaman islands on Christmas Day 1915 and raise an expeditionary force to raide towns on the Indian coast including Madras and Calcutta. His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meantime revealed to Beckett by ``Oren'', but given the successive failures of the Indo-German plans, the plans for the operations were abandoned on the recommendations of both the Berlin Committee and Knipping. Vincent Kraft was also responsible for passing on to British intelligence detailed information of the Berlin Committee and details of its activities in Washington D.C, in Siam, Dutch East Indies, and in Persia. Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war. Kraft, like Oren was not identified in intelligence reports and was only known by the codename ``Agent X''.

That same year, he purchased a Sony Portapak, one of the first commercially available video cameras. Video allowed Auder to translate Warhol's talent for making the banal glamorous and the glamorous banal into a diary practice which Auder himself did not consider fine art. His earliest works are travel logs and endearing portraits of friends including Hannah Wilke, Alice Neel, Annie Sprinkle, Eric Bogosian, Louis Waldon, and Larry Rivers. The label ``video artist'' was applied retroactively when Auder began exhibiting his work in 1980. At that time, he produced a series of works including scripted biographical material and video collages appropriating material from television.

Han Fei records that once Mizi Xia's looks faded, however, the Duke turned against his former lover, accusing him of stealing the carriage and of degrading the Duke by giving him a half-eaten peach. This story was so widespread amongst the literati of China that the phrase ``the bitten peach'' became a byword for homosexuality."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"16223759805931040503","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"7387074196865291426","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"10201641847309736017","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"7191959984199324932","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"no"}]}

This argument was made by William Ross in his book The Story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere (1939), in which he asserted that Whateley was a nun who was his ``lover and consort in their spiritual union''. She was born in 1561, the daughter of the well-known seafarer Anthony Jenkinson. She was living a secluded life among the nuns of the Order of St. Clare when she met Shakespeare. They fell in love, and Anne was about to leave the order to marry him when Hathaway revealed her pregnancy. Her authorship can be deduced from the sonnets, which she wrote as gifts to Shakespeare. They describe the history of her spiritual relationship with him. Hathaway is the Dark Lady of the sonnets, while Shakespeare himself is the Fair Youth. Their intimate friendship continued after his marriage to Hathaway; its deepening spirituality is explored in the later sonnets. Eventually the friendship was broken up by Hathaway's jealousy, and Shakespeare left for London. She wrote A Lover's Complaint, which was appended to the sonnets, to express Anne Hathaway's point of view."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"7917053321523182674","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13133868043235800488","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17870819119207423173","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"10201641847309736017","judgment":"yes"}]}

Until 1935 he worked alongside his younger brother, William, in their father's business. When the Rubins learned that Sweets Co., one of their major customers, was in serious difficulty, they became interested in acquiring control of the company. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubins eventually achieved control and agreed that Bernard would run the company as president. He changed the formula for Tootsie Rolls and increased its size. He moved the manufacturing plant from West 45th Street in Manhattan to Hoboken, New Jersey in 1938. He guided the company successfully through the war years, despite increasing difficulties in accessing the necessary raw materials.

Instead, John Hayes was educated at the dockyard until 1787, when he was sent to the ship of the line HMS Orion under Sir Hyde Parker. In 1790 he moved to the frigate HMS Pearl under Captain George Courtenay and followed Courtenay to HMS Boston in 1793 after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Within months, Boston was engaged in action with the French frigate Embuscade at the Action of 31 July 1793. Embuscade had been anchored in New York City harbour, and Courtenay sent an offer of battle in to Captain Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart, who sailed out to meet him. In the ensuing engagement, Courtenay was killed and Boston badly damaged.

Early in the war, Crastinus commanded his unit as it repelled an attempted crossing of a river by the Helvetii. Crastinus, whom Caesar considered to be amongst his best soldiers, was promoted by Caesar to the rank of Primus Pilus, or ``First Spear'' Centurion. This rank was one of exceptional prestige, since centurions of this rank commanded the first (primus), and most important, century in a Legion.

Another source states that the records of the Virginia Company showed that William Powell, a subscriber of the company, came to Virginia in 1611 with Lieutenant Governor Sir Thomas Gates aboard the Sea Venture. These statements are not entirely incompatible. The small ships of the Third Supply mission arrived in Jamestown in 1609 and Powell, who is identified as being in Jamestown before May 1610, must have been one of those ships. The Sea Venture, with Sir Thomas Gates and other prominent passengers, was beached in Bermuda after being caught in a hurricane and separated from the other ships.

The chief however did not stop his eldest son and heir, Ranald, from doing so. He died at Nunton in 1766, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Ranald. Ranald, 18th of Clanranald was educated in France where he became acquainted with Charles Edward Stuart. While his father was still chief of the clan, Ranald was, along with Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart and his brother Macdonald of Glenaladale, the first to join Charles Edward Stuart in 1745. After deciding to join, Ranald raised 250 clansmen and after the raising of the standard at Glenfinnan, Ranald lead 500 men to Dundee arriving there on 8 September and proclaimed James Francis Edward Stuart as king. The Macdonalds of Clanranald were present at the Battle of Prestonpans and the Battle of Falkirk. The Clanranald regiment, led by Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair, which fought at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746, consisted of 200 men. During the battle the Macdonald regiments were located on the Jacobite extreme left wing instead of their preferred place on the right wing. Popular legend has it that these regiments refused to charge when ordered to do so, due to the perceived insult of being placed on the left wing. The Clanranald regiment was disbanded at Fort Augustus, two days after their defeat at Culloden. Following the defeat of the Jacobite rebellion, Ranald spent some time in France, before finally returning to Scotland. He died at Nunton in 1776, where he was buried.

Holt was born March 30, 1811 in Prince Edward County, Virginia to David Holt (a carpenter) and Elizabeth McGehee of Prince Edward County, Virginia. By the time Jacob was in his middle teens, both parents had died, leaving him and his three siblings in the care of their uncle John MeGehee. It is thought that Jacob and his brother Thomas apprenticed with area carpenter William A. Howard during this time. In 1838, Jacob married Aurelia Phillips, and two years later, was documented as controlling the largest non-farming cadre of laborers in the county, with nineteen free men and twenty nine male slaves.

His father was Sardar Jai Singh and mother was Sardarni Sada Kaur. Baba Ji was born in Village Sherpur Kalan Jagroan in Ludhiana, India. He is regarded one of the highest saints in Sikhism. Baba Ji was a saint who meditated the gods name at every breath. At a very young age Baba Ji would go out at the middle of the night and meditate Waheguru. Once his parents on not seeing him in his bed got worried and started looking for him. They were surprised to see him sitting on the edge of the well with his eyes closed and in deep meditation.The above advice and instructions changed the life of Baba Nand Singh Ji and made him to go to the forest for further meditation. After a period of meditation, he returned from the forest and camped just outside the village and continued with his meditation irrespective of the local climatic conditions. The villagers upon observing this built a temporary house for him. After sometime the people from Kalera Village came and requested him to visit their village. He accepted their invitation and set out for Kalera. On the way he stopped at a well which was between Kaunke Village and Kalera and decided to camp there. The villagers over there made a small hut for Baba Ji and Baba Ji started his meditation.Baba Nand Singh Ji later established his ``Dera'' (centre) near Kalera in Punjab. He led a simple life and continued with the same principles of deep meditation. The food for the ``Dera'' would come from different devotees though no cooking was done at the ``Dera'' itself. This practice is still continued by the ``Dera'' now popularly known as Nanaksar. The food, ``langar'', is not prepared at Nanaksar but it is sent by the nearby villages and no matter how big the congregation, never ever has there been a shortage. No monetary offerings are ever made in front of the Guru Granth Sahib at Nanaksar, as the usual practice is at other Gurdwaras, but never a shortage of funds has occurred there. Baba Ji did not use any money on himself. He always served the community with true love and affection. It is said that once Maharaja Bhupender Singh of Patiala came to offer one lakh rupees for the Gurdwara fund but Baba Ji politely refused the offer. This was the first time someone had ever declined the offer of accepting money for a religious place from a Maharaja and of course the Maharaja felt bad and told Baba Ji, ``You will not find a donor like Bhupender Singh''. To this Baba Ji replied, ``You will not find another person who is prepared to sacrifice everything and yet be fully committed like Nand Singh''. This made the Maharaja humble and respectful and he bowed his head before Baba Ji. Baba Ji died in 1943 (13 Bhadron Sanmat 2000) at the age of 73. Today this dera is generally considered an antidote to the SGPC and has fragmented into various deras in India and abroad."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"10201641847309736017","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"5041981048872631403","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14953915240951219400","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3571030073219370006","judgment":"yes"}]}

Fan and the ambassador party left Macau aboard the Bom Jesus in January, 1708 bound for Lisbon.

He arrived in Lisbon in September 1708, and met King João V of Portugal soon afterwards. During his eleven year stay in Europe, he would meet the Pope, tour Italy, study Latin and theology, and was able to make many first-hand observations of aspects of eighteenth century Europe, which very few Asians had had the opportunity to do before him.

His movements thereafter are uncertain for a few years, although his son Constantine was born in 1639 or 1640. In 1643, he was appointed to the parish of Fyfield, Essex. In 1644, he argued for the biblical validity of presbyterian church government, with his views being published as The angel of the Church of Ephesus no bishop of Ephesus, distinguished in order from, and superior in power to a presbyter, dedicated to William Twisse. In August 1647, he moved from Fyfield to Bristol to take up a position as vicar of St Nicholas. In 1650, he was alleged to have preached against the council of state and, whilst protesting, did not deny all the charges. He was allowed to remain a minister on condition that he did not return to Bristol, although temporary permission was given on two occasions in 1652 and the prohibition was removed in April 1654, after Jessop had become rector of Wimborne Minster in Dorset. Also in 1654, Jessop wrote a preface to John Grayle's A Modest Vindication, entitled The nature of the covenant of grace, wherein is a discovery of the judgment of Dr. Twisse in the point of justification, clearing him from antinomianism therein.

He is popularly known as Ghufran Ma'ab, was the son of Seyyid Muhammad Muin bin Seyyid Abdul Hadi.

He completed his early studies in India, and in 1193 AH travelled to Iraq for further studies. Among his tutors in Iraq were great Fuqaha like Shaikh Ja'far Kashiful Ghita, and Wahid Behbehani. Later, he went to Mashhad (Iran) for further studies. Seyyid Dildar AliNasirabadi , while in India, was of Akhbari persuasion, but he changed to Usuli school after his intensive studies in Iraq. Upon his return to Lucknow, he became a Marja' in India, his fatwas being regarded as final by the Shia populace. His magnum opus in Theology (IlmulKalam) is known as ``ImadulIslam'' which he wrote in Arabic, in refutation of antishia arguments by FakhrudDin Razi. His detailed work in FIQH is 'MUNTAHAL AFKAR'.

As a bilingual anglophone writing during the 1960s, he was an influential figure in the Canadian political scene at a time when there was little communication between anglophone and francophone communities. According to John Gray (Canadian author) of the Globe and Mail, Frank Howard sought to introduce English and French Canada to one another. During the Quiet Revolution, nationalist sentiment ran high and the two ethnicities were seen as something like 'Two Solitudes' As an anglophone and a political moderate, Frank Howard was sympathetic to Quebec grievances without supporting separatist goals. At the Gazette, and later at the Globe and Mail, Mr. Howard broke many important stories including the infamous ``Vive le Québec libre'' speech by Charles de Gaulle as well as covering other seminal moments in Quebec history such as the founding of the Parti Québécois and the 'nationalization' of Quebec Hydro.

Growing up in a rural area, he spent his early life working on family farms in Bayou Pierre in DeSoto and Caddo Parishes. This led to a deep appreciation for the land and for hard work. In 1919 he graduated valedictorian from Shreveport High. In 1923 he received his undergraduate degree from Tulane University and then a medical degree in 1925. He participated in sports and was a member of Beta Theta Pi, the Nu Sigma Nu medical honor fraternity, and the Alpha Omega Alpha and Stars and Bars honor societies. Webb married Dorothy Dodd, daughter of Reverend Monroe E. Dodd, pastor of First Baptist Church, in 1926. They had two sons, Clarence, Jr. and Elmon Dodd. Webb practiced medicine in Texas, Minnesota, and Illinois from 1929 until 1931 when he received his Master's in Pediatrics from the University of Chicago. After receiving his Master's, Webb moved his family back to Shreveport and opened the first Well Baby clinic, in the Shreveport Public Health Department, with a friend. This clinic served the area for fifty years and Webb remained there until his retirement in 1976. He held teaching positions at four universities and served on the staff at six hospitals. By 1940, he was a charter member of the Society for American Archaeology and joined the Texas Archaeological Society where he attended annual meetings and participated in paper presentations. Webb's interest in archaeology did not occur until 1934 when he accompanied his sons on a Boy Scout trip near Menas, Arkansas. According to friends, this day changed his life. Webb began studying reports and techniques of well-known archaeologists such as James A. Ford. His next move was to contact Edward Neild and Michael Beckman, two Shreveport collectors who became lifelong friends of Webb's. In 1935 Webb traveled to Poverty Point and uncovered a cache of about 1,500 stone vessel fragments, which was the first of many visits to the site either surface collecting or conducting excavations. Even though his first large scale excavation project was some years in the future, salvage archaeology was occurring in the south during this time under the auspices of New Deal labor relief programs. One of the sites examined was at Marksville, Louisiana where the project archaeologists, Frank Setzler, aided by James Ford, became Webb's mentors. Over the next few years, Webb worked on many sites and met well-known archaeologists like Arden R. King, Robert Stuart Neitzel, Edwin Doran, Carlyle Smith, and William Malloy. James Ford and Edwin Doran's interest in the stratigraphic occurrence of potsherds in middens probably influenced Webb's interest in cultural chronology and site descriptions, especially at Poverty Point. In the 1930s Webb met James B. Griffin, who assisted him in pottery classification. During the same time, the University of Oklahoma began its archaeological program and Webb made friends with Robert Bell, David Baerreis, and Kenneth Orr. Webb also met Alex Krieger on an excavation in Texas and the two collaborated on a number of projects over their careers. Later in the 1930s Webb began to conduct his own excavations, with field most notably at Poverty Point and the Gahagan Mounds. He conducted projects regularly over the next thirty years. During his work at Poverty Point, Webb created an extensive and well documented surface collection from the site. Clarence Webb died January 18, 1991 in Shreveport, Louisiana, at eighty-nine years of age."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3571030073219370006","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"7520160179218527648","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"7917053321523182674","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4593294093459651288","judgment":"yes"}]}

As a boy, Knutzen was sent to his brother Johann Knutzen, an organist in Königsberg in East Prussia, and attended there a secondary school (the Altstädtische Gymnasium) from 1661 to 1664. In 1664, he registered at the university of Königsberg and in 1668, at the university of Copenhagen to do studies of theology. In between he earned some money as a private tutor. In 1673, he took a position as a village schoolteacher and auxiliary preacher in the Kremper Marsch (North Germany). However, he was dismissed at the end of that very year 1673, because he had sharply criticised the ecclesiastical authorities in his sermons. In the February of 1674 he went to Rome and in the September of 1674 to Jena (Middle Germany). There, Knutzen distributed handwritten pamphlets with atheistic contents. The town and the university of Jena carried out an investigation. In order not to be arrested, Knutzen went first to Coburg and then to Altdorf near Nuremberg. On October 22nd, 1674, he was last seen in Jena. Then his track is lost. The author Johannes Moller wrote in his biography of North German writers, Cimbria Literata (printed in 1744), that Knutzen had died in an Italian monastery, but that was probably only an invention made up to discredit both Knutzen and the Roman Catholic church."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"17595829233063766365","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3615053018572949242","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3571030073219370006","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13133868043235800488","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"yes"}]}

He rose to prominence during his participation in the suppression of the Khurramite revolt of Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Ash'ath, when he was noted by the governor of Iraq and the East, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. Under Hajjaj's patronage, he took Rayy from the rebel Umar ibn Abi'l-Salt in 701, and became the city's governor. Then, in late 704 or early 705, Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan appointed Qutayba as governor of Khorasan. The choice of Qutayba, who hailed from the relatively weak Bahila tribe, was intended by Hajjaj to heal the destructive feud between the South Arab or ``Yemeni'' (Azdi) and North Arab (Qaysi) tribal confederations in Khorasan by providing a governor who did not belong to either. The Bahila were neutral between the two groups, but generally allied themselves to the Qays, thus furthering Hajjaj's policy of emasculating Azdi power, which had been dominant in Khorasan during the governorship of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab. Furthermore, as Qutayba lacked a strong tribal base of his own, he could be expected to remain firmly attached to his patron. Qutayba would spend the next ten years of his life in Central Asia, consolidating and expanding Muslim rule there. In this endeavour, both his military and diplomatic and organisational abilities came him in good stead; most importantly, he was able to enlist the support of the local Iranian population and the powerful dihqan class."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"17595829233063766365","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4593294093459651288","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"10201641847309736017","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"7387074196865291426","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17154471385681223613","judgment":"no"}]}

Marcio trained extensively at the Gracie Barra academy from a very young age, and when he reached 15, his master Carlos Gracie Junior invited him to be an assistant coach at the gym. This allowed Feitosa to help his mother putting some much needed money towards the bills. Feitosa's hard training paid off and he received his black belt when he was 19.
