He received a ((NAM: B.S.)) in electrical engineering in 1927 from the University of Wisconsin, and a master's degree in physics in 1929, but never earned a Ph.D. He worked for Gulf Research Laboratories, the research arm of Gulf Oil, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then during World War II he moved to the Airborne Instruments Laboratory at Columbia University, where he applied the fluxgate magnetometer, an instrument he had invented at Gulf, to submarine detection. Following the war, he worked at Sperry Gyroscope Inc. developing gyrocompasses; then in 1953 he moved to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, where he worked on groundwater detection. At Scripps, where he moved in 1957, he directed a program that used his war-surplus flux magnetometers to measure the patterns formed by the Earth's magnetic field on the sea floor; his discovery of large shifts in the patterns in the Mendocino Fracture Zone was a major impetus behind the theory of plate tectonics, which his later measurements of heat flow on the sea floor also strongly supported."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"8046943553957200519","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3843891032536835374","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6504545382390319933","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"3422319225482654240","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"9448866739620283545","judgment":"yes"}]}

On his return to Germany he was invited to join a new advanced course in aeronautical engineering being offered by the DVL research institute in Berlin. Following in Frank Whittle's footsteps of a few years earlier, Schelp became interested in the problems of high-speed flight, and attempted to calculate the maximum speed an aircraft could obtain.

In 2004, the key Lemelson patents on bar code scanning were declared invalid for prosecution laches (unduly delaying the patent application process so as to issue the patents long after the invention would have been thought to be public domain.) and this loss has reduced Hosier's income and influence.

Just as her mother does, Carol Higgins Clark also writes suspense books. One main difference in the writings of the two Higgins Clarks is that Carol's books contain a slight sense of humor that her mother's, Mary Higgins Clark do not possess. All of Carol's novels feature Regan Reilly(the famous recurring character), plot points about male escorts, and pantyhose conventions that come from real sources. In her video for NJN Public Television, Carol explains how she uses her first job experience to help her with ideas about her book.

Believing firmly in history's ``Rational Movement'' (, harekat-e  øaqlƒ´), Adamiyat saw no conflict between normative judgement and claims to objectivity. Although predominantly published in Persian, he is often cited by Western scholars. His most famous book was Amir Kabir and Iran (Persian: Amƒ´r Kabƒ´r va ƒ™rƒÅn) (one of several re-publications: Tehran: Kharazmi Publishing, 1975/1354)."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"9448866739620283545","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"8866773797005693045","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3422319225482654240","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"1850295491265669817","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6504545382390319933","judgment":"yes"}]}

Specially trained 3-D technicians would be sent to each and every theater to install the special equipment, and to teach the projectionists how to keep it running. Allan Silliphant is still active in his advocacy of 3D film and digital technology. Chris Condon has been continuously been involved in the 3-D motion picture art and technology ever since. He has lectured at USC, UCLA, and Columbia college and is considered the worlds most experienced consultant for production and projection of theatrical 3-D films.

Marshall, Architect, 74, Dies Municipal Art Commission's Executive Secretary for the Last Eight Years. Honored By Universities Former Head of the American Psychological Association - Author of Many Works. Henry Rutgers Marshall, a leading architect of this city and Executive Secretary of the Municipal Art Commission, died of pneumonia yesterday in the Roosevelt Hospital at the age of 74. For almost half a century Mr. Marshall had been a practicing architect here. In 1902 he became President of the New York branch of the American Institute of Architects. He had lectured on art and architecture at Columbia, Yale and Princeton, and had written many books and magazine articles. The last years of his life were largely absorbed in the work of the Municipal Art Commission. He was appointed as a Commissioner in 1902 and served as the board's architectural member until 1905. Fourteen years later, in 1919, he accepted the post of Executive Secretary, and he became in many respects the chief executive of the commission. To his picturesque office in the tower of the City Hall there came plans, blueprints and designs of all descriptions for statues, school buildings, bridges, water works and other municipal structures which needed an expert architect's approval. Mr. Marshall was one of those whose duty was to select the good designs from the bad, to prevent inartistic or unsuitable structures from being erected and to set high standards for municipal architecture. Incidentally, the upper part of the City Hall's rotunda became, under Mr. Marshall's direction, something of an architectural museum, with photographs and paintings of notable works of architecture in Greater New York. He was born in New York on July 22, 1852, the son of Henry Perry and Cornelia E. Marshall. He received a ((NAM: Bachelor of Arts degree)) from Columbia College in 1873 and a Master's degree three years later. Almost to the day of his death he was interested in Columbia affairs, and he made his home at the Columbia University Club, 4 West Forty-third Street. In 1894 he joined the Columbia Faculty for a year, lecturing on aesthetics. He lectured at Yale in 1906 and 1907, and at Princeton from 1915 to 1917. Besides being an officer of the American Institute of Architects, Mr. Marshall was elected in 1907 to the Presidency of the American Psychological Association. He gave much attention to the theory of art and to philosophy. He made the principal address on esthetics at the St. Louis International Congress of Arts and Sciences in 1904. In the same year Rutgers University conferred on him the degree of L. H. D., and in 1910 Hobart College conferred that of Doctor of Science. Robert W. De Forest, President of the Municipal Art Commission, said yesterday that Mr. Marshall's death was a distinct loss to the city, as well as to his friends and admirers. ``His education as an architect and his personal relations with architects fitted him peculiarly to deal with the projects which come before the Art Commission, most of which are architectural,'' said Mr. De Forest. ``He cultivated sympathetic relations with the members of the different city departments with whom he came in contact. It is rarely that any man of talent finds a position for which he is peculiarly fitted, and it is still more rare that such a position finds such a man. ''The office will be filled by some successor, but no one can be found qualified to take the place which Mr. Marshall made for himself. `` Mr. Marshall's wife, Julia Robbins Gilman, died in 1888. Two sisters, Miss Julia P. Marshall and Miss Cornelia E. Marshall, survive him, as do his grandchildren, children of his daughter, the late Mrs. C. Minot Weld.

The Master and Senior Fellows of the College, in March of that year, had issued a further order to Skinner, that he ``come home to the College to clear himself of suspicion of being a papist''. What is unusual about this request is that such suspicion usually arose from a person's unwillingness to sign the oath of supremacy, a necessary part of the ((NAM: M.A.)) degree that in turn was a requirement for Major Fellowship of the College. However, by that point, Skinner had already received his ((NAM: M.A.)) (almost two years earlier, in 1677). Whatever the difficulty may actually have been, for which documentay evidence does not survive, ((PRO: it)) was overcome.

He is a native of Crowley Louisiana. He is the 12th child of Alice V. Andrus and the Late Warren Lee Andrus. Tracy Andrus graduated from Crowley High School in 1981 with honors. Tracy Andrus entered college at Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana where he graduated in 2000 with a degree in Criminal Justice. He later graduated from the University of Louisiana Monroe (2001)with a Masters Degree in Criminal Justice. On May 7, 2005, Tracy Andrus became the first African American In the United States to earn a PhD in Juvenile Justice. Dr. Andrus received his ((NOM: PhD)) from Prairie View A&M University. Dr. Andrus is credited with developing two evolving theories on crime. Enviroecogenetics and the Broke Theory. Dr. Andrus was elected President of the Southwestern Association of Criminal Justice in 2008. Dr. Andrus is the author of three books; Beneath the Skin of Black Folks, From Prisoner to ((NAM: PhD)), and Why Are So many Black Folks In Jail. Dr. Andrus is an ordained miinister and pastor of Edward Chapel MBC in Marshall, Texas. Tracy Andrus is the youngest of 12 siblings of Ms. Alice Andrus and the late Warren Andrus of Crowley, La. Tracy Andrus grew up in an era in which America was experiencing significant changes in its political, economic, and racial landscape. Tracy Andrus was in the third grade when schools in Louisiana were integrated. The merging of the races led to very different views among the liberals and conservatives of the time. It was during the Civil Rights Movements, Integration, Dr. king's Marches, Malcolm X's by any means necessary speeches, and the implementation of the directives of the Supreme Court's famous Brown Vs. the Board of Education era that Dr. Tracy Andrus was raised. Dr. Tracy Andrus notability comes to light as a result of his overcoming of obstacles that would have relegated most to the backwaters of society, yet Tracy Andrus rebounds and goes on to earn four college degrees and become the first African American in the U.S. to earn a PhD in Juvenile Justice. He earned his PhD degree from Prairie View A&M University. Dr. Tracy Andrus' Enviroecogenetics Theory suggests that criminal activity can be explained by analyzing three very dominant variables (Environments in whih persons are raised, the economic status of a person and their families, and the genetic makeup of individuals and their families). Dr. Andrus suggests that persons who are raised in low-socioeconomic environments are predisposed to a greater extent to become engaged in criminal activity. Economics or the lack of money is the strongest predictor of a person's liklihood to engage in criminal activity for various reasons."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"3843891032536835374","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"5521403179797574771","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14967864891122952713","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"8046943553957200519","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"9448866739620283545","judgment":"yes"}]}
