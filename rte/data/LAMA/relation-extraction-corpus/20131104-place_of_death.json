He was born in 1742, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he greatly distinguished himself. In 1769 he was called to the Irish bar, and he soon obtained a large practice, and won a great reputation both as a sound lawyer and an eloquent pleader. In 1772 he entered the Irish House of Commons as member for Ennis ; in 1776 he was elected both for Killibegs and Tulsk in Roscommon, and preferred to sit for the latter borough ; in 1784 and 1790 he was re-elected for Tulsk, and in 1798 he was chosen to represent the county of Kildare in the last Irish parliament. His eloquence soon made him as great a reputation in the Irish parliament as at the Irish bar, and he was recognised as one of the leading orators in the days of Grattan and Flood. Though an eloquent speaker, Fitzgerald was not much of a statesman ; he, however, supported all the motions of the radical party, and in 1782 he made his most famous speech in proposing a certain measure of catholic relief. In that year he married Catherine, younger daughter of the Rev. Henry Vesey, who was grandson of John Vesey, archbishop of Tuam, and cousin of Lord Glentworth, ancestor of the Viscounts de Vesci. Fitzgerald never sought political office, but he eagerly accepted professional appointments, which helped him at the bar. He thus became in rapid succession third Serjeant in 1779, second Serjeant in 1784, and prime Serjeant in 1787. In all the debates which preceded the final abolition of the independent Irish parliament Fitzgerald distinguished himself. He opposed the project of the union with all his might, and he was certainly disinterested in his cause, for in 1799 he was dismissed from his post of prime serjeant to make way for St. George Daly, who had been converted to the unionist policy. The Irish bar insisted on showing their respect for him, and continued to give him the precedence in court over the attorney-general and solicitor-general which he had held as prime serjeant. When the union was carried Fitzgerald accepted it, and he sat in the imperial parliament for Ennis from 1802 to February 1808, when he resigned the seat to his son, William Vesey Fitzgerald. He, however, was re-elected in 1812, but again resigned in January 1813, when he finally retired from politics. His name, like his son's Fitzgerald, William Vesey, 1783-1843, was unfortunately mixed up in the Mary Anne Clarke scandal with the Duke of York. This son, who was thoroughly reconciled to the union, held many important political offices, and in recognition of his services his mother was created Baroness Fitzgerald and Vesey on 31 July 1826, when James Fitzgerald himself refused a peerage. James Fitzgerald died at Booterstown, near Dublin, on 20 Jan. 1835, aged 93 ; the baroness had predeceased him 3 Jan. 1832. His youngest son, Henry Vesey Fitzgerald, was dean of Emly (1818-26), and dean of Kilmore from 1826 till his death, on 30 March 1860. He succeeded his eldest brother as third Lord Fitzgerald and Vesey in 1843."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"14894151489932721675","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"8841266254638695693","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"13855588585185268925","judgment":"no"}]}

He was educated at Eton, and, being superannuated on that foundation, went about 1772 to Cambridge, where 'for the sake of a scholarship he entered himself of Gonville and Caius College. ' In 1727, after taking B.A., he was admitted to deacon's orders, and in 1728 he was ordained priest, and proceeded to the M.A.. He served for several years as curate of Offley, Hertfordshire, and in 1739 became rector of Stepington, Huntingdonshire; the patron, the Duke of Bedford, also appointing him one of his chaplains. As reader to the Temple, to which he was chosen soon afterwards, he won the favour of the master, Bishop Sherlock, who in 1744 presented him to the vicarage of Bedminster, near Bristol, with the chapels of St. Mary Redcliffe, St. Thomas, and Abbot's Leigh annexed. To the same influence he owed a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral, and on receiving this he removed from London to Bristol, where he died on 21 Dec. 1774. He was an industrious writer in many kinds of composition. He published (1742) an Historical Dictionary of all Religions from the Creation of the World to the Present Times, a huge work in two volumes folio ; he translated Voltaire's 'Temple of Taste,' and part of Pierre Bayle's Dictionary; vindicated orthodox Christianity against Matthew Tindal ; converted a Roman catholic book ('Dorrel on the Epistles and Gospels') to protestant uses; edited John Dryden; wrote in defence of the immortality of the soul; and contributed the lives marked 'T' in the original edition of the 'Biographia Britannica. ' John Hawkins, in his Life of Johnson, credits Broughton with being the real translator of Jarvis's Don Quixote. 'The fact is that Jarvis laboured at it many years, but could make but little progress, for being a painter by profession, he had not been accustomed to write, and had no style. Mr. Tonson, the bookseller, seeing this, suggested the thought of employing Mr. Broughton ... who sat himself down to study the Spanish language, and in a few months acquired, as was pretended, sufficient knowledge thereof to give to the world a translation of ``Don Quixote'' in the true spirit of the original, and to which is prefixed the name of Jarvis. ' Broughton was a lover of music, and acquainted with Handel, whom he furnished with words for some of his compositions, including the drama of 'Hercules,' first given at the Haymarket in 1745. In private life he was of a mild and amiable disposition, but in controversy, though not discourteous according to the standard of his time, he was very economical in his concessions to his opponents, and he has been characterised in some respects as a weak and credulous writer."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"3633697795227880988","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"8841266254638695693","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13855588585185268925","judgment":"yes"}]}

After winning, at the age of twenty-two, the highest academic distinction at Louvain, he decided to follow his stepbrother and enter the Society of Jesus, and was sent to St. Ignatius of Loyola in Rome, who received him into the Society. On the completion of his novitiate, Theodorich was appointed professor of theology in Vienna, but was soon after appointed rector of the Jesuit College at Munich. Here, in 1562, one of the first productions in Germany of the morality play Homulus (corresponding to the English Everyman or the Dutch Elckerlijc) was given in Latin by the students under his direction. From Munich, where he was succeeded in 1565 by the celebrated Paul Hoffaeus, he was transferred to Dillingen, where for twenty years he presided over the college and the academy and laboured with zeal and success for the improvement of studies and for the religious training of the students. From 1565 to 1582 he held the office of chancellor of the university. In company with his distinguished brother, he attended the first provincial congregation of the Society of Jesus in Upper Germany, and furthered important reforms in the teaching of philosophy. In 1585 he was made rector of the college of Ingolstadt, and in this capacity became a member of the German commission which tested in practice the first draft of the Ratio Studiorum. At length, having spent thirty years at the head of three of the foremost colleges of Germany, he was sent to Lucerne in Switzerland to enjoy a period of rest; but soon again, at the age of sixty-three, he had to undertake the government of the college of Ingolstadt. Two years later, on the advice of his physician, he was relieved of the burden and allowed to return to Lucerne. A fortnight after his arrival the death of St. Peter Canisius was announced; the shock deprived Theodorich of memory and speech, an affliction which he bore with exemplary patience for seven years. For his amiable disposition and spotless purity of life he deservedly received the surname of Angelus 'angel'. In 1604, he was transferred again to Ingolstadt, where he died, and was interred in the church of the Holy Cross."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"8841266254638695693","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14894151489932721675","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13855588585185268925","judgment":"yes"}]}

He married there, living at Bordentown and Philadelphia. He operated a non-vocational craft school in Bristol, Pennsylvania from about 1800. He returned to England in 1803, and opened a London sugar refinery. He also continued inventing and performed ``experiments of a delightfully awful character''. In 1825, he went to Vienna to superintend the construction of a beet sugar works there, and subsequently did the same in Paris. Back in England he superintended the construction of the Thames Tunnel under Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Later in life he fell into debt and concluding that America presented a better opportunity to profit from his patents, he decided to re-emigrate, departing in autumn 1848. Returning to New Jersey, ``as a grey old man'' he lived with his third wife ``who was barely out of her teens''. Lectures there for local ladies could not survive their disapproval of his display of human skulls or the preserved organs of his deceased adopted son, his only child, whom he had dissected following the boy's death at age seven. He published the Journal of Human Nature and Human Progress, but this was short-lived, and he died in poverty and relative obscurity at Rahway or Elizabethtown, New Jersey, 28 June 1855."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1660398343823413797","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"9407096097752083601","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"13506264616570441534","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13232136026849814568","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"}]}

{"pred":"/people/deceased_person/place_of_death","sub":"/m/06ccf6","obj":"/m/04jpl","evidences":[{"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Cousins","snippet":"He was preeminently the interpreter of Sir Thomas Lawrence, his contemporary. During his apprenticeship to S. W. Reynolds he engraved many of the best amongst the three hundred and sixty little mezzotints illustrating the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds which his master issued in his own name. In the finest of his numerous transcripts of Lawrence, such as Lady Acland and her Sons, Pope Pius VII and Master Lambton, the distinguishing characteristics of the engravers work, brilliancy and force of effect in a high key, corresponded exactly with similar qualities in the painter. After the introduction of steel for engraving purposes about the year 1823, Cousins and his contemporaries were compelled to work on it, because the soft copper previously used for mezzotint plates did not yield a sufficient number of fine impressions to enable the method to compete commercially against line engraving, from which much larger editions were obtainable. The painter-like quality which distinguished the 18th century mezzotints on copper was wanting in his later works, because the hardness of the steel on which they were engraved impaired freedom of execution and richness of tone, and so enhanced the labor of scraping that he accelerated the work by stipple, etching the details instead of scraping them out of the ground in the manner of his predecessors. To this mixed style, previously used by Richard Earlom on copper, Cousins added heavy roulette and rocking-tool textures, tending to fortify the darks, when he found that the burr even on steel failed to yield enough fine impressions to meet the demand. The effect of his prints in this method after Reynolds and Millais was mechanical and out of harmony with the picturesque technique of these painters, but the phenomenal popularity which Cousins gained for his works at least kept alive and in favor a form of mezzotint engraving during a critical phase of its history. Abraham Raimbach, the line engraver, dated the decline of his own art in England from the appearance in 1837 of Cousins's print (in the mixed style) after Landseer's Bolton Abbey. Such plates as Miss Peel, after Lawrence (published in 1833); A Midsummer Nights Dream, after Landseer (1857); The Order of Release and The First inuet, after Millais (1856 and 1868); The Strawberry Girl and Lavinia, Countess Spencer, after Reynolds; and Miss Rich, after Hogarth (1873-1877), represent various stages of Cousins's mixed method. It reached its final development in the plates after Millais's Cherry Ripe and Pomona, published it in 1881 and 1882, when the invention of coating copper-plates with a film of steel to make them yield larger editions led to the revival of pure mezzotint on copper, which has since rendered obsolete the steel plate and the mixed style which it fostered. The fine draughtsmanship of Cousins was as apparent in his prints as in his original lead-pencil portraits exhibited in London in 1882. In 1885 he was elected a full member of the Royal Academy, to which institution he later gave in trust £15,000 to provide annuities for superannuated artists who had not been so successful as himself. One of the most important figures in the history of British engraving, he died in London, unmarried, on May 7 1887."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1660398343823413797","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"9080307652848457551","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17366110017494150315","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"9407096097752083601","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"}]}

The questions are precisely those of the Westminster Shorter Catechism; the answers are naked extracts from Scripture, without comment. In the second edition, 1825, a further progress is made; some of the Westminster questions are omitted, others are altered. Bankhead was moderator of synod in 1800. On 30 July 1812 William Glendy (died 24 July 1853, aged 71) was ordained as his assistant and successor. In 1829 Glendy took the congregation with him to join the heterodox remonstrant synod; but Bankhead remained on the roll of the general synod till his death, which occurred on 5 July 1833, he being then in the ninety-sixth year of his age, and the seventieth of his ministry (the inscription on his tombstone overestimates on both points). It is remarkable that the whole period of 220 years (1613--1833) in the history of Ballycarry congregation is spanned by the pastorates of four men, the interstices between their ministries amounting collectively to seventeen years. Bankhead was a man of much natural ability. A satirical poem of 1817 (''The Ulster Synod,`` by Rev. William Heron, of Ballyclare) describes him, in his eightieth year, as ''scattering bright wit, sound sense, and Dublin snuff. `` He published: 1. ''Faith the Spring of Holiness`` ii. 4, Belf. 1769 (funeral sermon for Arch. Edmonstone of Redhall, who left Bankhead his library). 2. ''A Catechism,`` &c. Belf. 1786, 12mo (the date is misprinted 1736); 2nd ed. Belf. 1825, 12mo (described above). He was twice married, (1) to Jane Martin, (2) in February 1812 to Mary Magill, and was the father of twenty-two children, nineteen of whom reached maturity, and some found distinction. His eldest son was John Bankhead, M.D., a leading physician of Belfast. Another was James Bankhead, ordained 23 March 1796, presbyterian minister of Bromore, co. Down (d. 10 Jan. 1824). Another son, Charles Bankhead, M.D., was private physician to the celebrated Lord Londonderry, who expired in his arms in 1822; he died at Florence, aged 91, and was father of Charles Bankhead, British envoy to Washington. The latest survivor of the twenty-two children was William Bankhead, unitarian minister at Brighton and Diss, Norfolk (1837--43), who left the ministry, and died in Edinburgh, 1881, aged 69."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"13855588585185268925","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"16676975657004889938","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"14894151489932721675","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"no"}]}

In November of this year he obtained a renewal of his pension of £3500 a year from the post office which he was holding in 1694, and in 1711 at the age of eighty was a competitor for the office of Lord Privy Seal.

His mother, Mary, a daughter of Dr. Brandreth of Houghton Regis, and the widow of Arthur Turner, would not allow her son to be sent to a public school, and he was educated by himself, a circumstance which engendered in him habits of isolation and restraint. At an early age he cultivated poetry, two small selections from his effusions circulating among his friends before he was twenty-three. Bray became a student at the Middle Temple in 1801 and was called to the bar in 1806. For some time he went the western circuit, but the profession of the law had from the first ill accorded with his disposition, and after five years of trial he abandoned it for the Church. He was ordained by the Bishop of Norwich about 1811, and in the following year, by the favour of the Duke of Bedford, became the vicar of Tavistock and the perpetual curate of Brent Tor. Almost immediately after his ordination he entered himself at Trinity College, Cambridge, and took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity as a ten-year man in 1822. In Tavistock he resided for the rest of his life, and if he differed from his parishioners on politics or preached over their heads, he retained their respect. He married the widow of C. A. Stothard Bray, Anna Eliza, and an amusing account of the habits of the worthy vicar and his wife is embodied in the latter's autobiography. Bray died at Tavistock 17 July 1857. During his lifetime he published several selections of sermons: 'Sermons from the Works of the most eminent Divines of the 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries,' 1818. 'Discourses from Tracts and Treatises of eminent Divines,' 1821. 'Select Sermons by Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man,' and a volume of his own, 'Discourses on Protestantism,' 1829. His poetical productions were for the most part circulated privately. After Bray's death his widow collected and published his 'Poetical Remains' (1859, 2 vols.), and also 'A Selection from the Sermons, General and Occasional, of Rev. E. A. Bray' (1860, 2 vols.) At one time he projected a history of his native town of Tavistock, and made considerable collections for it, but the undertaking was never completed. Many extracts from his journals describing the curiosities of Dartmoor and many of his poems are inserted in Mrs. Bray's 'Tamar and Tavy.

A mid-eleventh-century source asserts that Cynehelm briefly succeeded to the throne while still a child, and was then murdered by his tutor Æscberht at the behest of Cwoenthryth. This version of events ``bristles with historical problems'', according to one historian, and it is also possible that Cynehelm is to be identified with an ealdorman who is found witnessing charters earlier in Coenwulf's reign, and who appears to have died by about 812. The opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point: Simon Keynes has suggested that the ealdorman is unlikely to be the same person as the prince, and that Cynehelm therefore may well have survived to the end of his father's reign. Regardless of interpretation of Cynehelm's legend, there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in Ceolwulf's reign: a document from 825 says that after the death of Coenwulf ``much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings, nobles, bishops and ministers of the Church of God on very many matters of secular business''."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"9575511183572255983","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13224617482643406822","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3633697795227880988","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"no"}]}

He continued to sing for Handel, creating roles in ten of his operas and performing in every one of Handel's English-language oratorios, odes, and music dramas, with the sole exception of The Choice of Hercules. He also performed for Thomas Arne, and sang at the Chapel Royal. His marriage, during 1739, to Lady Henrietta Herbert, only daughter of James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave caused much scandal: Lord Egmont commented that ``there is no prudence below the girdle''. Lady Herbert died in 1753 and in 1759 he married again, this time to Charlotte Rich, whose father was the proprietor of the opera house in Covent Garden. After he died in 1761 Beard succeeded to the role until 1767, when deafness forced him to retire, selling Covent Garden's ownership for £60,000. He died at Hampton. Handel created several heroic leading roles for Beard, a revolution in the heyday of the castrato voice. The title roles in Samson, Judas Maccabeus, and Jeptha call for strength and expressive qualities over agility. He also sang the role of Farmer Hawthorne in the world premiere of Thomas Arne's Love in a Village. Charles Burney commented that he ``constantly possessed the favour of the public by his superior conduct, knowledge of Music, and intelligence as an actor.'' Burney's article in Rees's Cyclopaedia noted that Beard, ``an energetic English singer, and an excellent actor, was brought up in the king's chapel. He knew as much of music as was necessary to sing a single part at sight, and with a voice that was more powerful than sweet, he became the most useful and favourite singer of his time, on the stage, at Ranelagh, at all concerts; and in Handel's oratorios he had always a capital part, being by his knowledge of music the most steady support of the choruses, not only of Handel, but in the odes of Green and Boyce''."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"9407096097752083601","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"1568443823013462240","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"9408967419489906475","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"3422319225482654240","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15683306407052553031","judgment":"no"}]}

Indeed, the German artillery played by far the most important part in the victories of the Franco-Prussian War. Hindersin accompanied the king's headquarters as chief of artillery, as he had done in 1866, and was present at Gravelotte, Sedan and the siege of Paris.

Immediately after his profession in the following year, he was sent to Cologne to pursue the higher theological studies of the order, under the tutelage of the illustrious Albert the Great. From Cologne, where he spent four years, he went to Paris, to the Dominican studium of St. James, to perfect himself in the sciences and to prepare for the apostolate of preaching. Returning to Louvain in 1240, he was made professor of philosophy and theology--an office he filled with rare distinction.

The debates with Mommsen were legendary in their time. Guarini was also a pioneer in the study of the Oscan language. He was a first to create an Oscan/Latin Dictionary. His other works, numbering close to one hundred, range from brief monographs to books. Many of his works can be found today in the libraries of larger colleges and universities (Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Duke, Columbia etc.). By far, the largest collection of his works may be found at the Vatican Library in Rome.

Government imposed unnecessary taxes upon the farmers and the low class. Farmers were not appreciated for their hard work nor were given rights or money they deserved. Britishers had crushed the Muslims economically at their arrival in subcontinent so that they could not rise against them. They also made sure that Muslims should remain illiterate and uneducated. Thus, Muslims became politically backward and were unaware of laws and regulations. Due to this, Haji Shariatullah started this movement in 1818. He was sure that a revival of Islam is crucially necessary. Haji Shariatullah awakened the Muslims of Bengal by initiating the Faraizi movement. It was simply a peaceful protest against the cruelty of the government. This alarmed the Hindu and British Landlords and they exiled Haji Shariatullah to Nawabganj, accused of being behin the protest and disturbance in East Bengal. Later he died in Dhaka district in 1840. But the movement was carried along by his son, Mohsin-ul-Mulk, who was more learned and active in the movement than his father.

McWhorter taught, in 1910, a major graduate course in Greek which consisted of literary selections and exercises in grammar, written and spoken Greek, history, and poetry. The course description points out a problem with early graduate education at the University of Georgia that was common with many other institutions: ``studied from sources so far as the library resources of the University permit.'' Bocock also taught, by himself, ``An Introduction to New Testament Greek.'' These classes were in addition to undergraduate teaching and his duties as Dean. The New Testament Greek class was not offered after 1913 and after 1923, Bocock taught the major Greek class by himself. Bocock often decried the declining interest by students in Greek, symptomatic of this is the fact that the 1931-32 Graduate Bulletin notes: ``For courses in Greek Literature, consult the professor.'' 207 After 1931, the Greek Literature class would be transformed into ``Introduction of European Literature'' which had a prerequisite of three years of college-level Latin. Greek literature was no longer studied in the original language but was now ``Greek Literature in Translations.'' In a memorial to Bocock in 1948, Robert Preston Brooks wrote: ``Mr. Bocock was an altogether charming companion. Few men were so perennially delightful. The depth and variety of his knowledge of literature, ancient and modern, and of world history and contemporary affairs was impressive; and he invariably expressed his views in perfect English. No one was ever bored in his presence.'' Bocock continued to serve the Graduate School after leaving the deanship. He served as a member of and advisor to the Graduate Council into the 1940s. He retired from the University of Georgia in 1945. Bocock married Bessie Perry Friend of Petersburg, Virginia in 1885. The Bococks had two children: John Holmes Bocock and Natalie Friend Bocock.

Ambitious, he realized, as Gallier had, the opportunities New Orleans offered. For a time there seems to have been a loose partnership between the three. One example of their collaboration is Barton Academy in Mobile, Alabama, started in 1835. Both James Dakin and Gallier claim to have been the architects of certain New Orleans buildings of the period. Within a year, however, the Dakins left Gallier and practised for a time together as Dakin & Dakin and as Dakin, Bell & Dakin; later still they split. Charles began an ill-fated branch office in Mobile, Alabama, where he supervised the construction of the Government Street Presbyterian Church, completed in 1836. The collapse of a row of warehouses he designed affected him so deeply that it is thought to have been a cause contributing to his early death in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. He had gone to Texas to begin anew. That year (1839) the Great Fire of Mobile also destroyed much of the firm's incomplete work there."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"1568443823013462240","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"3422319225482654240","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"9408967419489906475","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"9407096097752083601","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"15683306407052553031","judgment":"yes"}]}

Throughout his official career he had devoted his leisure to study. At a very early period he conducted a magazine at Mirat which contained many valuable articles on Indian subjects. With a view to assisting the projected official 'Glossary of Indian Judicial and Revenue Terms,' he published in 1845 at Agra his 'Supplement to the Glossary,' which is rightly described by Professor H. H. Wilson as 'replete with curious and valuable information, especially as regards the tribes and clans of Brahmans and Rajputs. ' A second edition appeared in 1860. His chief work, however, was the 'Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Mohammadan India,' in which he proposed to give an analysis of the contents and a criticism of the value of 231 Arabic and Persian historians of India, but of which he only lived to publish the first volume (Calcutta and London, 1849).

She became a mother's helper in the household of William Augustus Brown who was a Salem ship- holder. In 1854 the Browns moved to Brooklyn, New York. Bridges and her sisters moved with them. She lived with the Browns in order to take care of the children, but she also opened a school with her sisters. Bridges later studied art, after being inspired by sculptress Anne Whitney, at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia with William Trost Richards and became very close to his family . He was a Pre-Raphaelite advocate and her style was greatly influenced by him. After the American Civil War she studied for a year in Europe, but later returned to The United States in the 1860s. This was a time when water coloring was a very respected style and she quickly gained popularity with her exquisite depictions of flowers and birds. She was considered a specialist in her field and focused on the beauty and serenity of small bits of nature. In 1876 many of her paintings were reproduced and sold by publisher and lithographer Louis Prang. This success eventually led to a job as a designer for Prang's firm. For this job Bridges designed Christmas cards and she kept it until 1899. She moved to Connecticut in the early 1890s and led a quiet lifestyle. In her lifetime, Fidelia Bridges became Associate of the National Academy of Design and a member of The American Society of Painters in Watercolor (now The American Watercolor Society). She was the only female artist out of seven famous 19th century American artists in this society. She exhibited her work sporadically from 1863 until 1908.

Brewer was no stranger to controversy, challenging Catholicism and Communism directly and debating frequently; yet he also demonstrated a willingness to change his views, especially those regarding the doctrine of grace."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"8841266254638695693","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"16676975657004889938","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"15683306407052553031","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"yes"}]}

He died at Twickenham on 9 August 1761, aged 68, and was buried in a vault in Grosvenor Chapel, South Audley Street. Gilbert seems to have possessed few qualifications to justify his high promotion in the church. He was neither a scholar nor a theologian. Nor were these deficiencies compensated by graces of character. A friendly witness, Bishop Newton, speaks of his being regarded as ``somewhat haughty;'' while Horace Walpole, describes him as ``composed of that common mixture of ignorance, meanness, and arrogance.'' John Newton, William Cowper's friend, when seeking to obtain ordination from him, found Gilbert ``inflexible in supporting the rules and canons of the church.'' His imperious character is illustrated by his refusal to allow the civic mace to be carried before the mayor of Salisbury in processions within the cathedral precincts, for which he claimed a separate jurisdiction, disobedience to which, it is said, caused an unseemly personal scuffle between him and the mace-bearer. According to Newton, Gilbert was the first prelate to introduce at confirmations the practice of the bishop laying his hands on each candidate at the altar rails, and then retiring and solemnly pronouncing the prayer once for the whole number. This mode was first observed at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham; it ``commanded attention, and raised devotion,'' and before long became the regular manner of administering the rite."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"17366110017494150315","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"8841266254638695693","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"}]}

From 1712 until 1720 he directed the missions of Nahuelhuapi and Calbuco, and in 1730 he was in Concepción during the earthquake of July, which destroyed that city. His frequent voyages gave him an opportunity to study the archives of the Company of Jesus, and about 1736, in Santiago, he began to compile his history. From 1740 till 1758 he served in the missions of Araucania, where he learned the language of the Indians. He intended to write a complete history of Chile, when a decree of Charles III exiled the Jesuits, and, notwithstanding his advanced age, Olivares had to leave the country.

Born in Detroit, Michigan on May 9, 1908, he was the brother of June Carroll, the brother-in-law of Sidney Carroll and the uncle of Steve Reich and Jonathan Carroll. He is perhaps best known for his series of musical revues, Leonard Sillman's New Faces, which introduced many major stars to Broadway audiences, such as Eartha Kitt, Inga Swenson, Paul Lynde and Maggie Smith. Versions of New Faces were produced in 1934, 1936, 1943, 1952, 1956, 1962 and 1968. The very first New Faces in 1934 included actors Henry Fonda, Imogene Coca and Frances Dewey Wormser. Songwriter Arthur Siegel, who contributed many songs to the New Faces series and radio show, described Sillman's philosophy: ``He believed that a revue should be a potpourri, a bouillabaisse, in which there was something for everyone. Pace was very important. He didn't want to give an audience a chance to think about what it just saw. The music had to be nonstop.'' Sillman also produced many other plays from the 1930s into the late 1960s, including All in Fun (1940), Mask and Gown (1957) and the Family Way (1965). His autobiography Here Lies Leonard Sillman: Straightened Out at Last was published by the Citadel Press in 1959.

She was born Shirley Ximena Hopper in Del Rey, California, in 1886. She graduated in 1907 from Stanford University, where she discovered art. Shirley married Lawrence Russell, an engineer, in 1909. When he died in 1912, she began teaching in Palo Alto, and dabbling in painting. In 1921, she and her son came to Hawaii for a visit and decided to stay. She studied under Hawaiian artist Lionel Walden during the 1920s and traveling to Europe several times to further her art education. She studied in Paris during the 1930s and the cubist influence can be seen in a number of her works. She taught art at President William McKinley High School in Honolulu for more than 20 years. Around 1935-1936, the Japanese publisher Watanabe Shozaburo (1885--1962) published several woodblock prints she designed. The majority of these prints depict colorful and detailed tropical flowers, while at least one print, Carmel Mission, is a California landscape. In the course of her art career, Russell had three one-woman exhibitions at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, and taught art at the University of Hawaii and the Honolulu Academy of Arts. She launched many young artists on their careers when they were her students at McKinley High School, including Satoru Abe (1926-) and John Chin Young (1909--1997). Although she painted in representational style herself, she was a staunch supporter of abstract art. She continued to paint almost daily until her death in Honolulu in 1985, at the age of 98.

There is a tradition that when Dickens visited Boston, a line of New England portraitists was already fawning on shore, hoping to be the first to capture the great novelist's image on canvas. But Francis Alexander reached the writer well ahead of his peers--by traveling in a small advance boat to greet Dickens as his vessel entered the harbor.

In 1860 he was made British consul at Rome, but had scarcely entered upon the post when an opportunity presented itself of reorganizing the amorphous department of antiquities at the British Museum, which was divided into three and ultimately four branches. The Greek and Roman section naturally fell to Newton, who returned as Keeper, and held the office until 1885, declining the offer of the principal librarianship made to him in 1878. The Mausoleum Room, to accommodate the treasures he had found in Asia Minor, was built under his supervision, but the most brilliant episode of his administration was the acquisition of the Blacas and Castellani gems and sculptures. The Farnese and Pourtals collections were also acquired by him. He took a leading part in the foundation of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, the British School at Athens, and the Egypt Exploration Fund. He was Yates professor of classical archaeology at University College, London, from 1880 to 1888. His collected Essays on Art and Archaeology were published in 1886. When, on his retirement from the Museum, his bust by Boehm, now placed in one of the sculpture galleries, was presented to him as a testimonial, he desired the unexpended balance to be given to the school at Athens. After his retirement he was much occupied with the publication of the Greek inscriptions in the British Museum, but his health failed greatly in the latter years of his life. He died at Margate. He married in 1861 the daughter of his successor in the consulate at Rome, the painter Joseph Severn; she was Ann Mary Newton, herself a distinguished artist.

He showed strong Presbyterian views during the civil war, with, however, an attachment to the king, and in 1651 he was imprisoned briefly with some other ministers for his share in Christopher Love's plot to recall Charles II of England. He was released on 30 June 1652, and was formally reinstated as vicar of St. Stephen's Walbrook. He obtained great fame and popularity as a preacher until the Restoration, when he was ejected for nonconformity. Notwithstanding the rigor of the acts against dissenters, Watson continued to exercise his ministry privately as he found opportunity. Upon the Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 he obtained a license to preach at the great hall in Crosby House. After preaching there for several years, his health gave way, and he retired to Barnston, Essex, where he died suddenly while praying in secret.

Zirbes was a vital figure in education and reading instruction. Zirbes began her teaching career at an elementary school in Cleveland from 1903 to 1919, and then went on to work at the experimental Lincoln School at Teachers College, Columbia University from 1920 until 1926. She finally earned her doctoral degree from Columbia University in 1928. In the years leading up to her retirement (1928-1954) she taught at Ohio State University. In all her teaching years combined, she taught for 61 years, including summer sessions until 1964. During so many years of teaching, Zirbes endured some of the most important issues affecting education in the United States throughout the twentieth century. In Cleveland, she taught a class of fifty-six fourth graders that were all children of immigrants. During her time at Columbia, she listened to Edward L. Thorndike, John Dewey, and William Bagley discuss the value of testing, and heard Bagley argue with William Heard Kilpatrick about Kilpatrick's Project method. Zirbes coauthored many articles with William S. Gray. Her dissertation made her one of the country's experts on teaching children to read. She never really considered herself an expert at reading because she did not believe in isolating one subject from other subjects. Zirbes founded the laboratory school at Ohio State, this school continued under her influence for over thirty years. She believed children learned things best when their interest was high. Zirbes supported the child-centered approach only if the teacher had a good understanding of the skills she wanted the children to learn, and carefully lead her class in that direction. The next step in learning was to provide good learning experiences that would enlarge children's understanding and their vocabulary. Zirbes believed that numerous other elements contribute to learning. The first, that the lesson should be meaningful to the child, and second, that learning should be intrinsically motivating. The final two elements of learning, as Zirbes saw it, were that the lesson should stimulate thinking and lastly it should be integrated with other subjects. As Zirbes neared retirement, critics like Arthur Bestor attacked her beliefs on education. Her answer to this criticism came in the form of a book, Spurs to Creative Teaching (1959). She died on June 9, 1967 in Columbus, Ohio."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"9407096097752083601","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"6553533562826940072","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"15683306407052553031","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"16676975657004889938","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"}]}

William Barnard of Water Stratford, Bucks, and great-grandson of William Barnard, bishop of Derry, was born at Wedbury, Oxfordshire, in 1799. He was educated at Westminster and Sandhurst, and obtained a commission in the grenadier guards in 1814. He served on the staff of his uncle, Sir Andrew Francis Barnard during the occupation of Paris, and afterwards on that of Sir John Keane in Jamaica. Later he was with his battalion in Canada, and filled various staff appointments at home. A newly made major-general, Barnard landed in the Crimea in 1854, in command of a brigade of the 3rd, or Sir Richard England's, division of the army, with which he was present during the winter of 1854--5. When General Simpson succeeded to the chief command on the death of Lord Raglan, Barnard became his chief of the staff, a position he held at the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855. Afterwards he commanded the 2nd division of the army in the Crimea. After brief periods of command at Corfu, Dover, and Shorncliffe, Barnard was appointed to the staff in Bengal, and reached Umballa, to take over the Sirhind division, towards the end of April 1857, when rumours of impending mischief were gathering fast. On 10 May occurred the outbreaks at Meerut and Delhi, the vague tidings of which reaching Umballa were at once sent on by Barnard, and gave the first warning of actual revolt to the commander-in-chief, General Anson, then at Simla. Upon Anson's death at Kurnaul a fortnight later, Barnard received in charge the scanty force available for the movement against Delhi, and at its head he struck a heavy blow at the mutineers, at Budlee-ke-Serai, on 8 June following, taking up his position on the ridge commanding the north-west front of the city of Delhi the same evening. The value of this victory, as the historian Kaye has truly said, was not to be measured by returns of killed and wounded or captured ordnance. ''It gave us an admirable base of operations--a commanding military position--open in the rear to the lines along which thenceforth our reinforcements and supplies and all that we looked for to aid us in the coming struggle were to be brought. And, great as this gain was to us in a military sense, the moral effect was scarcely less; for behind the ridge lay the old cantonments, from which a month before the British had fled for their lives. On the parade-ground the British head-quarters were now encamped, and the familiar flag of the Feringhees was again to be seen from the houses of the imperial city. `` Four weeks of desultory and unprofitable fighting followed, the strength of the mutineers in the city--strangely under-estimated in most other quarters at the time--being to Barnard's force as six to one in men and four to one in guns. And then, like his predecessor Anson, Barnard was stricken down at his post by the pestilence that was among the British ranks. He died of cholera on 5 July 1857, eleven weeks before the fall of the city, leaving behind him the name of an officer, skilful, if little versed in Indian warfare, and a brave and chivalrous gentleman."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"13506264616570441534","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"9080307652848457551","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"13224617482643406822","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"no"}]}

He established his headquarters in the island of Tortuga, which at that time was the rendezvous of all the buccaneers. Montauband frequently ravaged the coasts of New Spain, Cartagena, Florida, and North America, as far as Newfoundland. In 1694 he escorted to France a great number of prizes that he had taken in the West Indies, but the excesses that were committed by his crew at Bordeaux forced him to abandon that port in January 1695, and he cruised for some time on the coast of Guinea, capturing many ships from the Dutch and English. After nearly losing his life by the explosion of a powder magazine he returned to Tortuga, but resolved to abandon his mode of life, and returned to Bordeaux, where he died. He wrote Relation du voyage du sieur de Montauband, capitaine de flibustiers sur les côtes de l'Amérique du Sud et de Guinée dans les années de 1694 et 1695, which is printed in the collection of Las Casas (Amsterdam, 1698).

Charles XII he regarded as the first captain of all time, and it was at Stockholm that Folard began to formulate his tactical ideas in a commertary on Polybius. On his way back to France he was shipwrecked and lost all his papers, but he set to work at once to write his essays afresh, and in 1724 appeared his Nouvelles D'dcouvertes sur la guerre dans une dissertation de Polybe, followed (1727--1730) by Histoire de Polybe traduite par ... de Thuillier avec un commentaire de M. de Folard, Chevalier de l'Ordre de St Louis. Folard spent the remainder of his life in answering the criticisms provoked by the novelty of his theories. He died friendless and in obscurity at Avignon in 1752. An analysis of Folard's military writings brings to light not a connected theory of war as a whole, but a great number of independent ideas, sometimes valuable and suggestive, but far more often extravagant. The central point of his tactics was his proposed column formation for infantry. Struck by the apparent weakness of the thin line of battle of the time, and arguing from the cuneus of ancient warfare, he desired to substitute the shock of a deep mass of troops for former methods of attack, and further considered that in defence a solid column gave an unshakable stability to the line of battle. Controversy at once centred itself upon the column. While some famous commanders such as Marshal Saxe and Guido Starhemberg approved it and put it in practice, the weight of military opinion throughout Europe was opposed to it, and eventually history justified this opposition. Among the most discriminating of his critics was Frederick the Great, who is said to have invited Folard to Berlin.

Believing in the ideal of industry as China's savior, he travelled to the University of California in 1924 to research economics. During this time, he closely read Anti-Dühring, The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, The Communist Manifesto, and other famous Marxist works. He returned to China in 1926. Jian was a patriot, and participated in the protests leading up to the March 18 Massacre of that year. He published his first Marxist interpretation of Chinese history during the 1930s, and joined the Communist Party of China in 1937. In 1934, while serving as secretary to Tan Zhen, deputy head of the Judicial Yuan, Jian went on a tour of numerous countries around the world.

After his part in history, he quit his job as a security guard because he did not receive a raise for his role in discovering the burglary. In 1973, the topical song magazine Broadside published the song ``The Ballad of Frank Wills'', written by Ron Turner. Mr. Turner later recorded the song for Broadside/Folkways album, Broadside Seven. Wills worked for the comedian/activist Dick Gregory, lived in the Bahamas, and had a Harry Nilsson album dedicated to him. He made some money on the talk show circuit, but was unable to hold down a steady job. He returned home to South Carolina in the mid 1970s and cared for his stroke victim mother for several years. He was convicted of shoplifting in 1983. After her death in 1993, he was so destitute that he was washing his clothes in a bucket until James Kilby founded an organization, Treat Every American Right (TEAR) to raise money for Wills. Frank Wills died nearly penniless from a brain tumor on September 27, 2000, at University Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, having lived in poverty most of his life. Spike Lee loosely incorporated Frank Wills' story into Lee's 2004 film, She Hate Me.

She corresponded with Linné and Johann Reinhold Forster (1729-1798), who encouraged her to publish her entomological observations and devote herself to the museum of Oxford Hall. She enriched the collections by insect additions in particular thanks to specimens sent to her by Peter Simon Pallas (1741-1811). Her brother Ashton, who had gone to live in the United States of America, sent her many specimens, in particular birds, which were described by Pennant. She sent Linné specimens of birds and insects which were not described in his Systema Naturae. She died in Warrington.

He became deeply interested in the legal status of the medical profession, and organised the Association of Surgeon-Apothecaries of England and Wales, with the object of improving the education and status of the profession. As chairman of this body Burrows was most indefatigable, and had a large share in the movement which led to the passing of the Apothecaries' Act in 1815. The society voted him five hundred guineas on its dissolution. On the formation of the first court of examiners of the Apothecaries' Company, on the passing of the act, Burrows was appointed an examiner; but early in 1817 he resigned, owing to the unfair conduct of the court of assistants. On this question Burrows published a Statement of Circumstances connected with the Apothecaries' Act and its Administration in 1817.

In the 1940s, Desoille referenced Jung's collective unconscious and presented his own conception of the mind based on Freud's three instances. The transference identified by Freud, Desoille believed, could be expressed and resolved in the directed waking dream. Finally in the 1950s and 1960s, concomitant to his political affiliations, Desoille held to a Pavlovian conception of neurosis, based on reflexes, in what was termed a ``rational psychotherapy''. Those reflexes that are poorly adapted could be dissolved through the directed waking dream method, according to Desoille, and, starting in the imagination, new dynamic stereotypes could be formed.

His wife was awarded sole guardianship over the children in 1815 and the children were later renamed with their mother's maiden name. Lathom appears to have travelled extensively, visiting New York and Philadelphia and attempting to publish two novels in 1820.

Shepstone had been summoned home to advise the Colonial Office on South African affairs and he reached England in May 1879; on his return to Natal he retired (1880) from the public service.

It was through his long tenure as the head of the Appropriations Committee, though, that Jacobetti had the largest impact. Jacobetti's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee wielded significant influence over direction of revenue in the state of Michigan and this made Jacobetti a powerful politician. Though the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is relatively low in population in comparison to the rest of the state, Jacobetti used his position to help direct sometimes significant funding to the Upper Peninsula (considering its low population), including the building of the Superior Dome, among other projects. It was his position and influence that was pointed to when an effort to pass a term limits amendment to the state constitution was initiated, an effort which was successful. In the last few years of his tenure on the committee, there was a scandal involving misappropriation of funds by the committee. Jacobetti was initially stripped of his chairmanship and a number of Fiscal Agency employees were investigated and imprisoned.

Around 2002, he began using a wheel chair after he fell a couple times getting to the mic.

However, nothing could have weakened his heart more than to see a world ignore his call for a world sobriety check. More love for humanity you could not find, it was shameful that he remained an addict so long. His articulate speech and immaculate writing skills created an unbelievable individual that fostered the careers of so many. With unmarried son David's sudden passing two years later at the youthful age of 50, the sole heir to Ed's works is his sister, Helen.

In the course of a few years the number of Scotch missionaries was increased to four. In 1843, on the disruption of the church of Scotland, Anderson and his colleagues joined the Free Church, and thenceforward the mission was carried on in connection with that church. The subject of female education soon attracted Anderson's attention. There was no diffi- culty in securing the attendance of girls of the lower castes; but in the case of native caste girls the difficulty was, and still is, very great. Indian girls marry early, and native parents see none of the material benefits to be derived from their education, which induce them to send their sons to mission schools, even at the risk of their being led to change their religion. But these obstacles were gradually overcome in some measure, and before Anderson's death seven hundred Hindu and Mohammedan girls, the majority of the former belonging to families of good caste, were under instruction in the schools of the mission. In this branch of his work Anderson was greatly helped by Mrs. Anderson. Anderson died at Madras in March 1855, after a short illness. He had laboured indefatigably for eighteen years at the work for which he had been set apart; only once during that period revisiting his native land, whither he was accompanied by the Rev. P. Rajahgopál, one of his first converts.

In the extended version of the film, his performance is included. In his scenes, Hentschel tells Otto Günsche that he is staying in order to maintain the generators. Later, he goes to the surface and looks at the burnt remains of Adolf Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels. Returning to the bunker, he finds a group of female Soviet soldiers who ask where Hitler and Braun are, then ask to be taken to Eva's wardrobe.

At thirteen he was entered at Corpus Christi, Cambridge, under Thomas Tenison, became a fellow of his college in 1668, and M.A. in 1670. After some years spent in tuition and in studying medicine, he went to France and attended the lectures of Raymond Vieussens at Montpellier, under the patronage of Ralph Montagu (afterwards Duke of Montagu), then British ambassador to France. To him Briggs dedicated his Ophthalmographia, an anatomical description of the eye, published at Cambridge in 1676, on his return from France. He proceeded M.D. at Cambridge in 1677, and was elected a fellow of the London College of Physicians in 1682. In the latter year the first part of his Theory of Vision was published by Robert Hooke (Philosophical Collections, No. 6, p. 167); the second part was published in the Philosophical Transactions in 1683. The Theory of Vision was translated into Latin, and published in 1685 by desire of Sir Isaac Newton, who wrote a commendatory preface to it, acknowledging the benefit he had derived from Briggs's anatomical skill and knowledge. A second edition of the Ophthalmographia was published in 1687. Several points in Briggs's account of the eye are noteworthy, one being his recognition of the retina as an expansion in which the fibres of the optic nerve are spread out ; another, his laying emphasis upon the hypothesis of vibrations as an explanation of the phenomena of nervous action. Briggs practised with great success in London, especially in diseases of the eye ; was physician to St. Thomas's Hospital 1682-9, physician in ordinary to William III of England from 1696, and censor of the College of Physicians in 1685, 1686, 1692. In 1689, according to a curious memorial on one sheet preserved in the British Museum, Dr. Briggs was at great expense in vindicating the title of the crown to St. Thomas's Hospital, but was himself dismissed from his post, owing, as he states, to the machinations of a rival physician. From the same sheet we learn that, although he attended the royal household with great zeal for five years, he could get no pay ; and notwithstanding that in 1698 William III promised that he should be considered, this was of no avail. In consequence of these circumstances, apparently early in Anne's reign, he begs for consideration in regard to the hospital appointment. He died 4 Sept. 1704, at Town Malling in Kent. His son, Henry Briggs, chaplain to George II, and rector of Holt, Norfolk, erected a cenotaph to his father's memory in Holt church in 1737. The inscription is quoted by Munk. His portrait, by R.

Thomas Willis, merely because he knew it was his patron's intention so to bestow the living if he had lived to effect an exchange. Cole now went into a hired house at Waterbeach, five miles from Cambridge. This house, little better than a cottage, was very uncomfortable. To make matters worse, he discovered that he had got into a parish which abounded with fanatics of almost all denominations. Writing about this period to his friend Father Charles Bonaventure Bedingfeld, a Minorite friar, he says: ``My finances are miserably reduced by quitting the living of Bletchley, and by half my own estate being under water by the breaking of the Bedford river bank at Over after the great snow in February was twelvemonth;'' and he proceeds to remark: ``Yet I am not disposed to engage myself in any ecclesiastical matters again, except greater should be offered than I am in expectation of. I have already refused two livings, one in Glamorganshire, the other in Oxfordshire; for I have no inclination to the duty and do not love to be confined.'' He still had a hankering after a semi-monastic life, for he wrote to Bedingfeld on 20 April 1768: ``Could I have my books and conveniences about me, I should nowhere like better than to finish my days among my countrymen in a conventual manner,'' though not, he takes care to explain, as a monk or friar, because he had no religious vocation. A second overflow of the Hundred Foot river at Over still further diminished the value of his estate, and on 18 February 1769 he wrote to the Rev. John Allen: ``I hardly ever now really enjoy myself for three days together, as the continued wet weather alarms me constantly; so that I am come to a resolution to sell my estate and purchase elsewhere, or buy an annuity.'' At Michaelmas 1769 he had his first attack of gout, which complaint afterwards caused him severe and frequent suffering. About May 1770 he removed from Waterbeach to a small house at Milton,near Cambridge. Here he spent the remainder of his days, and was familiarly distinguished as ``Cole of Milton,'' though he was sometimes spoken of jocularly as ``Cardinal Cole.'' In May 1771, by Lord Montfort's favour, he was put into the commission of the peace for the borough of Cambridge. In the following year Bishop Keene, without any solicitation, sent him an offer of the vicarage of Madingley, but he civilly declined it. He was, however, on 10 June 1774 instituted by Dr. John Green, bishop of Lincoln, on the presentation of Eton College, to the vicarage of Burnham, Buckinghamshire, vacant by the cession of his uterine brother, Stephen Apthorp, D.D. He still continued to reside at Milton, where he died on 16 December 1782, his constitution having been shattered by repeated attacks of gout. He lies buried in St. Clement's Church, Cambridge, under the steeple, which bears on its front his motto, Deum Cole. On the right hand of the entrance to the church is a monument, with an inscription stating that the steeple was erected with money left by him for the purpose,"}],"judgments":[{"rater":"18393280535210278125","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13506264616570441534","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13855588585185268925","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17366110017494150315","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"}]}

After helping to remove Idi Amin, Bazira served as Deputy Director of intelligence, and then as Director of Intelligence in Uganda in 1979. He produced a government report predicting that there would be a massive genocide in Rwanda that would lead to the collapse of order in Central and Eastern Africa, and proposed granting citizenship to Rwandan refugees and other displaced Africans in Uganda, as a means of preventing genocidal warfare. In August 1993, Amon Bazira was assassinated in Kenya at Nakuru, allegedly with the complicity of Tiny Rowland, Yoweri Museveni and Daniel arap Moi.

June 24, 1967) was a prominent pianist, composer and bandleader, best known for his calypso recordings. According to various sources, he was born either in Barbados or in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago; he grew up in Trinidad, the son of an mother and a Sephardic Jewish father. He travelled widely in the Caribbean and South America in his youth, absorbing a wide variety of musical influences. He was leading his own band by 1902. He made his first phonograph recordings in Trinidad in 1914, and soon after first traveled to New York City, where he made more recordings and set up a publishing business. He would continue to travel back and forth between New York and Trinidad for the rest of his life. He is unusual as a calypsonian in the fact that his instrument was the piano, (not exactly the best instrument for the calypso tent.) It is because of this that his style is more orchestrated and arranged. Instead of marching the streets or playing the tents, as was the custom for the average calypsonian, he instead became a darling of the local elites, playing the high class balls and debutante dances. In fact, around this time (1903-4) he began giving piano tutorials to the mayor's daughter. Don Hill, an expert on the subject, who wrote detailed liner notes on the ``Goodnight Ladies and Gents, the creole music of Lionel Belasco'' CD, claims that ``According to rumour'', he taught her a bit more than simply how to play the piano.... she was shipped back to England in disgrace, and Belasco was forced to flee to New York, where he died."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"18393280535210278125","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"14894151489932721675","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"17366110017494150315","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"skip"}]}

He studied initially at Jesus College, Oxford, commencing in 1624 aged 22, before moving to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with a BA from Dublin before returning to Oxford to obtain his MA in 1632. His movements thereafter are uncertain for a few years, although his son Constantine was born in 1639 or 1640. In 1643, he was appointed to the parish of Fyfield, Essex. In 1644, he argued for the biblical validity of presbyterian church government, with his views being published as The angel of the Church of Ephesus no bishop of Ephesus, distinguished in order from, and superior in power to a presbyter, dedicated to William Twisse. In August 1647, he moved from Fyfield to Bristol to take up a position as vicar of St Nicholas. In 1650, he was alleged to have preached against the council of state and, whilst protesting, did not deny all the charges. He was allowed to remain a minister on condition that he did not return to Bristol, although temporary permission was given on two occasions in 1652 and the prohibition was removed in April 1654, after Jessop had become rector of Wimborne Minster in Dorset. Also in 1654, Jessop wrote a preface to John Grayle's A Modest Vindication, entitled The nature of the covenant of grace, wherein is a discovery of the judgment of Dr. Twisse in the point of justification, clearing him from antinomianism therein. On 16 April 1658, Jessop died at Wimborne; he was buried there. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and his son, Constantine, who became rector of Brington, Northamptonshire and a prebendary of Durham Cathedral."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"6553533562826940072","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17366110017494150315","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"yes"}]}

He was the founder of the Sidleian Lectures of Natural Philosophy at Oxford. Sedley was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, but left without taking a degree. There his tutor was the poet Walter Pope. The second surviving son of Sir John Sedley and Elizabeth, William, succeeded to the baronetcy in 1645. Charles Sedley inherited the title (5th baronet) in 1656 when his brother William died. By his first wife Lady Katherine Savage, daughter of John, 2nd Earl Rivers he had only one legitimate child, Catherine, Countess of Dorchester, mistress of James II. The couple lived in Great Queen Street. After his first wife had been sent to a convent in Ghent on account of a serious mental condition, Sedley in vain tried to obtain a divorce. He met Ann Ayscough, probably around 1670, by whom he had two illegitimate sons, William and Charles Sedley. William died in infancy, the brother Charles was knighted by William III after the coronation in 1689. The relationship with Ann Ayscough lasted to the end of Sedley's life.

Richard Flavel, described as ''a painful and eminent minister,`` who was incumbent successively of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, Hasler and Willersey, Gloucestershire (from which last living he was ejected in 1662), was born in or about 1630 at Bromsgrove. Having received his early education at the schools of the neighbourhood, he entered University College, Oxford, at an early age, and gained a good reputation for talent and diligence. On 27 April 1650 he was sent by ''the standing committee of Devon`` to Diptford, a parish on the Avon, five miles from Totnes, where the minister, Mr. Walplate, had become infirm. On 17 Oct. 1650, after examination and the preaching of a ''trial sermon,`` he was ordained Mr. Walplate's assistant by the classis at Salisbury. He continued to minister at Diptford for about six years, succeeding the senior minister when he died, and endearing himself greatly to the people, not only by his earnestness, but by his easy dealings with them in the matter of tithes. In 1656 he removed to Dartmouth, though the Diptford emoluments were much greater. On the passing of the Act of Uniformity (1662) he was ejected, but continued to preach in private until the Five Mile Act drove him from Dartmouth. He kept as near it, however, as possible, removing to Slapton, five miles off, and there preached twice each Sunday to all who came, among whom were many of his old parishioners. On the granting of the indulgence of 1671 he returned to Dartmouth, and continued to officiate there even after the liberty to do so was withdrawn. In the end he found himself obliged to remove to London, travelling by sea and narrowly escaping shipwreck in a storm, which is said to have ceased in answer to his prayers. Finding that he would be safer at Dartmouth he returned there, and met with his people nightly in his own house, until in 1687, on the relaxation of the penal laws, they built a meeting-house for him. Just before his death he acted as moderator at a meeting of dissenting ministers held at Topsham. He died suddenly of paralysis at Exeter on 26 June 1691, and was buried in Dartmouth churchyard. Wood bitterly comments on the violence of his dissent. Flavel was four times married: first to Jane Randal; secondly, to Elizabeth Morries; thirdly, to Ann Downe; and, lastly, to a daughter of the Rev. George Jeffries. There is a portrait of him in Dr. Williams's library, London. He was a voluminous and popular author.

His first instrument was the violin, which he studied at age 10. While attending school in Hořice he was classmates with Jan Kubelík, with whom he maintained correspondence. He spent time performing both the violin and the cornet for a circus band in Prague. He also performed as an aerialist acrobat with the Rentz Circus in Germany, but an accident in 1886 ended this line of work. His father was a sculptor, and Bohumir also studied this art. He emigrated to the United States in 1889, paying the fare in part by performing with the ship's orchestra. Moving to Chicago, English sculptor H.R. Saunders furthered his profession in that area. Bohumir followed Saunders to Indianapolis and was soon employed, along with his brother, as a sculptor by General Lew Wallace and also working on the Soldiers`` and Sailor's Monument. During this time he joined the When Clothing Company Band, playing the cornet and soloing on this instrument. Before long he was hired by John Philip Sousa, but left in 1898 to join Thomas Preston Brooke's Chicago Marine Band, where he spent the next two years. During this time he studied with Weldon of Chicago's Second Regiment Band. In 1901 he spent some time with Phinney's United States Band, but he joined the Duss Band permanently that year. This group was based at Madison Square Garden, at $800 per-month and became its assistant conductor in 1903. This band, led by Frederick Innes, was not as well known, but he was hired as soloist, and the heavy touring schedule and two solos per concert gained him wide exposure. His solos would result in requests for multiple encores. Studying bandleaders Creatore and Vessela, he adopted a wild 'lionesque' hairstyle that became his trademark. He became acquainted with Joseph Jiran, who owned a Czechoslovakian music store in Chicago. With Jiran's encouragement, he formed his own band in 1906 styled as Kryl's Bohemian Band by 1910 with the Cimera brothers. This group worked for Columbia, Victor, and Zonophone, recording works by such composers as Smetana, Dvorak, and Safranek. He earned the distinction of the first Czech musician to record on phonograph cylinders. World War I interrupted his professional career, as he was serving in the U.S. Military. Here he attained the rank of Lieutenant and was given the title ``Bandmaster of all the Military Camp Bands in the country``. Immediately after the war he was touring with his bands, including many appearances on the Chautauqua circuit. This activity continued until he dismantled the band in 1931. From 1926 to 1929 he would spend winters at his mansion in Tarpon Springs, Florida. He built a bandshell on his property and would give numerous concerts each year. Through his compositions and band touring, he became a millionaire by the mid 1920s. The Great Depression did not affect his personal affluence as much as others, as he was a bank president and a known financier in 1932. He later formed a ``Women's Symphony Orchestra'' that featured daughter Josephine on violin and daughter Marie on piano. He also formed and conducted the ''Kryl Symphony Orchestra``, which featured soloists such as Florian ZaBach and vocalist Mary McCormic. His public musical career ended in the late 1940s, when he had difficulties with the American Federation of Musicians, because although his musicians were well taken care of, he did not pay scale. His last groups played popular dance music as well as ''heavier classics``. Before his musical retirement, he had traveled more than one million miles and soloed more than 12,000 times. His touring included many small towns such as Albany, Oregon and Bend, Oregon, where his orchestra was the first appearance by any symphony orchestra there. Aside from the United States, he toured Canada, Cuba, and Mexico with his bands and orchestras and America and Europe with his daughters. He later formed booking agency and a music bureau. An Honorary Doctor of Letters was given to him in 1957. He died at his summer home in Wilmington, New York, on August 7, 1961, leaving an estate valued at over 1 million dollars. His widow was Mary Jerabek Kryl."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"9080307652848457551","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"16676975657004889938","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"}]}

Conant was its first governor but, in 1627, was replaced by John Endicott. He remained active in town affairs and is today memorialized in a statue across from the Salem Common. He died on November 19, 1679 in Beverly, a nearby town which he also helped found."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"14404876356854644346","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"18393280535210278125","judgment":"skip"},{"rater":"9407096097752083601","judgment":"no"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"yes"}]}

He continued his work for the State Department where, despite the seeming success of his ambassadorship, his time in Bolivia had served to undercut Henderson's diplomatic career. This was due in large part due to his unpopularity with the Pentagon and CIA stemming from his early opposition to the 1964 coup by Barrientos and his sometimes rocky relationships with US military officials who resented his efforts to rein in the influence and involvement of American forces during the Guevara insurgency. Also harmful to Henderson's career was a British documentary film that had been made in Bolivia during the height of the insurgency in which Henderson had appeared and given an interview. The film depicted Henderson himself in an unflattering light and in addition was also highly critical of both the United States and the Barrientos regime. The film and Henderson's involvement in it proved a major embarrassment for both him and the State Department. Henderson would go on to hold several mid-level bureaucratic posts in the State Department's Bureau of Inter-American Affairs before being appointed to a sub-ambassadorial post as the Deputy US Representative to the Organization of American States in charge of social and economic issues. It was during this time that he met his second wife Marion, whom he married in 1970. He retired from the State Department in 1975 and returned to his hometown of Weston, Massachusetts where he later began a second career as the president of Land's Sake, a nonprofit group he had co-founded in 1980 to promote the benefits of small-scale land use in farming and educational programming.

The hijackers, characterized by many as terrorists or rebels, seized the ship and took complete command of the vessel under Galvao's leadership. In this process, they isolated the vessel by cutting off all communication, and killed one officer and wounded several others. Galvao used the hijacking to send radio broadcasts from the ship calling attention to his concerns and views on what he characterized as the Portuguese regime of fascism. The event received wide international press coverage. It is understood that the hijackers forced the captain of the ship, Mario Simões Maia, along with crew members, to redirect the ship's course. The liner evaded both the U.S. Navy and British Navy for eleven days before docking safely at Recife, Brazil. On February 2, 1961, the hijackers were met by Brazilian officials off the coast of Recife. After negotiating with Brazilian officials, Galvão released the ship's passengers in exchange for his own political asylum in Brazil. Galvão later announced that his original intentions for this operation were to sail the ship to the Portuguese overseas province of Angola. Galvao further claimed that he had planned to declare the independence of Angola from the Portuguese government, in opposition to António de Oliveira Salazar's regime.

Fleming took holy orders in August 1588 and was ordained deacon and priest by Dr Richard Fletcher at Peterborough Cathedral. Almost as soon as he was ordained Fleming became chaplain to Charles Howard, Lord High Admiral of England, and not chaplain to Catherine Countess of Nottingham as previously thought, although among his papers were prayers said to the Howard family when they were together; in the 1590s Fleming was called as a witness in a court case and stated his occupation as chaplain to Lord Howard. Another error in previous articles about Fleming was that he was an antiquary; he was never a member of the Society of Antiquaries and while he did amass a collection of manuscripts, his motivation for collecting them was not consistent with those of an antiquary. As well as performing the duties of a private chaplain, Fleming was a curate at St Nicholas' Church, Deptford, assisting Reverend Thomas Macander (better known as the man who buried Christopher Marlowe, and possibly Fleming assisted with this burial). Between 1589 and 1606 he preached eight times at St. Paul's Cross, further evidence that he was a trusted ``establishment man''. The sermons are now lost. On 19 October 1593 he was collated by Archbishop John Whitgift to the rectory of St. Pancras, Soper Lane, London. He took his work as a rector as seriously as he did his writing; Fleming saw his parish through at least two plagues. Fleming died at Bottesford, Leicestershire, on 18 September 1607, while on a visit to his brother Samuel, the rector of that parish, and was buried under the chancel inside the church. Despite Fleming's humble origins, his coffin was interred with those of the earls of Rutland. A memorial plaque bearing an epitaph poem written by Fleming marks the approximate site. He was survived by his brother Reverend Samuel Fleming and his sister Hester. Perhaps Fleming's greatest legacy is the fifty known books that he wrote, translated or contributed to."}],"judgments":[{"rater":"6553533562826940072","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"17966044108931836156","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"16676975657004889938","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"13855588585185268925","judgment":"yes"},{"rater":"4185483665120273114","judgment":"yes"}]}
